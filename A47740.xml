            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is putting on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> giving up

Profeſſion</hi> of His <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin:</hi> So the Renouncing of our
<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> as
<hi>Publick</hi> a <hi>Diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of Him; and a Formal
<hi>Apoſtaſy</hi> from His <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the <hi>Devil</hi> has been moſt buſie in all ages
(but has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed moſt, in our latter Corrupt times) to Prejudice Men, by
many falſe Pretences, againſt this <hi>Divine Inſtitution.</hi> Having
been able to perſwade ſome quite to throw it off, as <hi>Pernicious</hi>
and <hi>Hurtful:</hi> Others to think it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Lawful</hi> to be done, but
to lay no great ſtreſs upon it, and ſo uſe it, where it is Enjoined, as
a thing <hi>Indifferent.</hi> Others deny it to <hi>Infants,</hi> upon this
only Ground, That they are not ſuppos'd Capable of being Admitted into the
<hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which He has made with Men: For, if they are
Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being admitted into the <hi>Covenant,</hi> there can be no Reaſon
to deny them the outward <hi>Seal</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>But this being Foreign to my preſent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking, which is to
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to the <hi>Quakers</hi> the Neceſſity of an <hi>Outward</hi>
or <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> in the General (for as to Perſons capable of it,
we have no Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie with thoſe who deny it to All) therefore, I have
not digreſs'd into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Subject, which is, that of <hi>Infant
Baptiſm,</hi> in the following <hi>Diſcourſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Yet thus much I will ſay of it, in this place, That
<hi>Infants</hi> are Capable of being admitted into the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and
therefore that they cannot be Excluded from the outward <hi>Seal</hi> of it.
The Conſequence the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> cannot deny. And that they are
Capable, I thus prove. They were Capable under the <hi>Law,</hi> and before the
<hi>Law,</hi> of being admitted as Members of the <hi>Covenant</hi> in
<hi>Chriſt</hi> to come, made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> by the <hi>Seal</hi> of
<hi>Circumciſion,</hi> at the Age of <hi>Eight Days:</hi> And therefore there
can be no Reaſon to Exclude them from the ſame Privilege, to the ſame
<hi>Covenant,</hi> now that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is come; unleſs
<hi>Chriſt</hi> had debarr'd them from it: The <hi>Law</hi> ſtanding
ſtill, as it was, where He has not <hi>Alter'd,</hi> or <hi>Fulfill'd</hi>
it. But He has not debarr'd them. Nay; on the contrary, He has yet further
confirm'd their being within the <hi>Covenant.</hi> He called a <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Child,</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> xviii. 2, 3, 5.) and ſet him in the midſt of His
<hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and Propoſed him as a Pattern to <hi>Them,</hi> and to
all <hi>Adult</hi> Chriſtians. And ſaid, That none ſhould <hi>enter into
the Kingdom of Heaven, except thoſe who ſhould become as little
Children.</hi> And that whoever did Receive a <hi>Little Child</hi> in <hi>His
Name,</hi> did Receive <hi>Chriſt</hi> Himſelf. And (<hi>ver</hi> 10.)
<hi>in Heaven, their Angels</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>do always behold the
Face of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> And therefore He bids us <hi>Take
heed that we deſpiſe not one of theſe Little Ones;</hi> by which term tho
<hi>Adult</hi> Perſons are ſometimes meant, yet in the Texts before quoted,
it is expreſly apply'd to <hi>Little Children.</hi> And what greater
<hi>Deſpiſing</hi> of them can be, than to Reject them as no Members of
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Body,</hi> and conſequently unworthy of the

               <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>diſpleaſed</hi> with His
<hi>Diſciples</hi> (<hi>Mar.</hi> x. 14.) for hindring <hi>young
Children</hi> to be brought unto Him. And will He be <hi>pleaſed</hi> with
the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> for the ſame thing? <hi>He took the little Children
up in His Arms, put His hands upon them, and bleſſed them.</hi> Did He
<hi>Bleſs</hi> thoſe who were not <hi>Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of being within His
<hi>Covenant?</hi> He ſaid, <hi>Of ſuch is the Kingdom of God,</hi> (which
is a term our <hi>Saviour</hi> us'd, to Expreſs the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the
<hi>Goſpel</hi>) Are they not then within the <hi>Covenant</hi> of the
<hi>Goſpel?</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays, that where either of the
Parents is a Chriſtian, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. 14.) the <hi>Children</hi> are
<hi>Holy:</hi> That is, within the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And
purſuant to this, when any man was Converted, his <hi>Children</hi> were
<hi>Baptized</hi> with himſelf. This is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of what we read ſo
often in <hi>The Acts,</hi> that ſuch a Man was <hi>Baptized</hi> with his
<hi>Houſhold.</hi> And it was the Cuſtom before with the <hi>Jews,</hi>
that when they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any man as a Proſelyte to their Religion, they
<hi>Baptized</hi> his <hi>Children</hi> with himſelf. Let this ſuffice for
the preſent. And Proceed.</p>
            <p n="2">II. When <hi>Rebellion</hi> had fully compleated it ſelf,
in the <hi>Murther</hi> of the King, 1648. It ſoon ſpawn'd a multifarious
<hi>Schiſm</hi> of 30 or 40 different <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi> in
<hi>England,</hi> at the ſame time, of which Catalogues were then Printed,
moſt of all theſe threw away <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> And threaten'd an
immediate and total Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, in this
<hi>Iſland.</hi> But, by the great Mercy of God, the <hi>Reſtauration</hi>
of the <hi>Church,</hi> with the <hi>King,</hi> 1660. has extinguiſhed the
very <hi>Names</hi> and <hi>Memory</hi> of theſe, all but 4 or 5 of the
Principal <hi>Sects.</hi> The <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> (Mother of all the
reſt) <hi>Independents, Ana-baptiſts, Quakers,</hi> and
<hi>Muggletonians.</hi> I am told of ſome <hi>Sweet-ſingers,</hi> got up of
late. But they are yet inconſiderable. They may Increaſe, and all the
reſt Revive, if warm'd by a Plenitude of <hi>Indulgence.</hi> The
<hi>Socinians,</hi> or <hi>Unitarians,</hi> are already got very high, who make
nothing of the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> but as <hi>In-effectual Forms.</hi> So
think the <hi>Deiſts,</hi> who pretend to higher Quality than theſe. And
the <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinarians</hi> will quarrel with none of theſe. All
<hi>Deiſts</hi> are <hi>Latitudinarians;</hi> and, tho' they deſpiſe
<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and all <hi>Reveal'd</hi> Inſtitutions, yet they can
ſubmit to them, becauſe they are <hi>Eſtabliſhed</hi> by <hi>Law,</hi>
as they would to any thing elſe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than loſe a <hi>Penny,</hi> or
their <hi>Eaſe.</hi> But the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Muggletonians</hi> have
(more ſincerely) Rejected <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as not allowable, becauſe
they think ſo.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The <hi>Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> &amp;c. do
indeed uſe <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> but as a thing ſo <hi>indifferent,</hi> that
many of them will ſuffer a Child to dye without it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Baptize it
<hi>Privately,</hi> or not upon a <hi>Sermon</hi> or <hi>Lecture-day,</hi> or
before <hi>Sermon,</hi> rather than after it; And an Inſtance can be given,
ſince this late Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of <hi>Presbytery</hi> in
<hi>Scotland,</hi> of a Child who dyed in the Church, in <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-time;</hi>
but the Miniſter ſuffered that, and the repeated Requeſts of the
<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> rather than go out of his wonted method of Baptizing
<hi>after Sermon,</hi> he thought <hi>Baptiſm</hi> ſo little material!</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:95759:4"/>But the People being us'd to a greater veneration of
<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> under the <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> Adminiſtration, and
taking the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> contempt of it ſomewhat uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters there, to inſtruct them better, had publick
Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all over the Nation, to ſhew the no Neceſſity of the
<hi>Outward</hi> or <hi>Water-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi> I will not ſay the <hi>ENGLISH
Presbyterians</hi> go ſo far; they are one Degree further from the
<hi>League</hi> &amp; <hi>Covenant.</hi> I hear that they do now Adminiſter
<hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm PRIVATELY,</hi> in and about <hi>London.</hi> Which the
<hi>Independents</hi> do ſtill Refuſe, (I have it from ſome of
themſelves) let the caſe be never ſo urgent, even tho' the child ſhould
dye without it, before one of their <hi>Sermon</hi> or <hi>Lecture-days.</hi>
As for the other <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper,</hi> I
hear that ſome <hi>Independent</hi> Congregations in <hi>London</hi> are come
to uſe it <hi>Monthly.</hi> And the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> more frequently
than they us'd to do; or than they do in other places. The frequency of
<hi>Communion</hi> in the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Churches, in ſome manner
forcing them to it, that their people might not think themſelves more
neglected by them, than others are. But their own <hi>Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> and
the <hi>Value</hi> they have for this <hi>Sacrament</hi> will better appear by
their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour while they had the Power in their own hands; and could
<hi>Dictat</hi> to others, inſtead of <hi>Following</hi> or
<hi>Complying</hi> with them. And during their <hi>Government</hi> in the late
<hi>Revolution,</hi> tho' they did not down-right (as the <hi>Quakers</hi>)
declare <hi>War</hi> againſt it, &amp; <hi>Extripate</hi> it <hi>at
once;</hi> yet they plainly ſeem'd to have had a deſign to have
<hi>Inch'd</hi> it by Degrees out of the world, as far as it was in their
power, by letting it fall into <hi>Diſſuetude,</hi> that ſo it might be
<hi>Forgotten,</hi> &amp; <hi>Dye.</hi> And they had almoſt Effected it,
among thoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappy People that were led by them. For from the Birth of
their <hi>Covenant,</hi> A. D. 1638. they had not this Sacrament in many
<hi>Pariſhes</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſome for 10, ſome for 12, ſome
for 15 years; which was almoſt their whole <hi>Reign.</hi> And in the
<hi>Indulg'd</hi> and <hi>Conniv'd</hi> at Pariſhes to the Year 1683. many
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (who were not Debarr'd for any Exception againſt them) ſome of
50, 60, 70, and 80 years of Age, never receiv'd this <hi>Sacrament</hi> once in
their lives: This I know from certain Information. And ſince their preſent
Eſtabliſhment in this <hi>Revolution,</hi> their neglect of this
<hi>Sacrament</hi> is likewiſe Notorious. Four Years after which,
<hi>viz.</hi> in the year 1693. it had not been Adminiſtred in
<hi>Edenbrugh;</hi> &amp; but once a year, at the moſt, ſince. We may
imagine then how it has been obſerved in the Country Pariſhes.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> are a <hi>Sprig</hi> of the <hi>Scotch Covenant</hi>
Tranſplanted thither: Which in that change of Soile, has taken deep Root, and
ſpread Intolerably. And the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Derry,</hi> in his late
Clear and Rational <hi>Diſcourſe concerning the Inventions of Men in the
Worſhip of God,</hi> And <hi>Two</hi> following <hi>Admonitions,</hi> has
made it fully appear, That not <hi>One</hi> in <hi>Ten</hi> of them do ever
Receive this <hi>Sacrament</hi> in the whole Courſe of their Lives: And the
reſt very rarely, even now ſince this laſt Revolution. And in the Former
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of 41, he gives <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndenyable Inſtances, that in ſeveral
Churches, even in <hi>Dublin,</hi> after the turning out of the <hi>Epiſcopal
Miniſters,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:95759:5"/>had not been
Adminiſtred till the Reſtauration, 1660, that is, in ſome Churches for
<hi>Ten,</hi> in ſome for <hi>Twelve</hi> Years together.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Theſe <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and in
the <hi>South</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> were ſent
from <hi>England,</hi> and had learnt the Contempt of this Sacrament there.
Where, even in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> it was not <hi>Adminiſtred</hi> in the whole
<hi>Univerſity,</hi> from the Ejection of the <hi>Epiſcopal Clergy,</hi> in
the Year 1648. to the Reſtauration in 1660, as is obſerved in the
<hi>Antiquit-Oxon.</hi> So that the <hi>Quakers</hi> have only taken that out
of the way, which the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had worn into Diſ-uſe.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And from all theſe Enemies, and the ſubtle
Inſinuations which they have broached in Prejudice of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s
Holy Inſtitution of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and likewiſe of the <hi>Lords
Supper</hi> (for both are ſlightedly the ſame Perſons, and upon the
ſame Grounds) it is to be feared, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, even of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> have been wrought, tho' not into a
<hi>Diſ-uſe,</hi> or downright <hi>ſlight,</hi> yet into a leſs
<hi>Eſteem</hi> and greater <hi>Indifferency</hi> as to theſe <hi>Holy
Sacraments</hi> than they ought; and conſequently receive leſs Benefit by
them; much leſs than if their <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and their <hi>Faith</hi>
were better rooted, and more ſublime. Nay, there is not any Degree of
<hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency,</hi> but what is Culpable, in this Caſe; and may bring a
<hi>Curſe</hi> with it, inſtead of a <hi>Bleſſing:</hi> for,
<hi>whatſoever,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Religious</hi> Worſhip, <hi>is not
of Faith, is ſin.</hi> And according to our <hi>Faith,</hi> it is to us, in
all our Performances of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII. For all theſe Reaſons, tho' this Diſcourſe was
wrote wholly on Behalf of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> yet, I hope, it will not be
un-uſeful to many others, to ſee the <hi>ſtrong Foundation, Great
Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,</hi> and <hi>In-eſtimable Benefits</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm</hi>
and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper,</hi> when Duly Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd, and
Receiv'd with <hi>Full Faith</hi> and <hi>Aſſurance</hi> in the
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that He will not fail to
aſſiſt His own <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> when we approach unto them, with
ſincere <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and undoubting Dependance upon His
<hi>Promiſes.</hi> And many of the Objections hereafter anſwered, tho'
uſed by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to <hi>Invalidate BAPTISM,</hi> are likewiſe
inſiſted on by ſeveral of the <hi>Sects,</hi> which I have named above,
to <hi>Leſſen</hi> and <hi>Diſparage</hi> it. In which ſenſe, the
following Diſcourſe, tho' it reſpects the <hi>QUAKERS Chiefly,</hi> yet
not them <hi>Only,</hi> for it contains the joint Arguments of all the
ſeveral ſizes of the <hi>Oppoſers,</hi> or <hi>Contemners</hi> of
<hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. But as to the immediate Occaſion, which engaged me
in this Work, it was upon the Account of a particular Perſon, who had been
Educated from his Childhood in the <hi>Quaker</hi> Principles, and Communion.
And the Objections which are here conſidered againſt <hi>Baptiſm,</hi>
are theſe which, at ſeveral conferences with other <hi>Quakers,</hi> to
whom that Perſon brought me, were inſiſted upon. At l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ngth, after more than Twelve Months
conſideration of this ſingle Point, and diligently Reading over, and
weighing every particular, which <hi>Rob. Barclay</hi> had wrote, in his
<hi>Apology,</hi> againſt the <hi>Outward,</hi> or <hi>Water Baptiſm,</hi>
it pleaſed God ſo to open the Eyes, and perſwade the Heart of this
Gentleman, that, having Informed himſelf in the true Principles of the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion, as contained in our <hi>Church Catechiſm;</hi>
he has lately with great joyfulneſs, and ſatisfaction, Received the
<hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the Church of
<hi>England.</hi> And it was his Deſire, that this <hi>Diſcourſe</hi>
(tho' wrote for his Privat <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe) might be made Publick, in hopes, that it
may have the like Effects upon others, as it has had upon himſelf, by the
great <hi>Mercy</hi> of God. And I knowing ſeveral others who have of late
been <hi>Convinced</hi> and <hi>Baptiſed,</hi> in the ſame manner, as this
Gentleman; I have not Reſiſted his invitation to contribute my
<hi>Mite</hi> towards the Recovery of ſo many <hi>Thouſand</hi> ſouls as
now for 46 years, have thrown off the Sacraments of <hi>Chriſt's</hi>
Inſtitution: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as one main Cauſe, have leſt the Subſtance,

            <head>SECT. I. That <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19. was meant of
<hi>Water-Baptiſm.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Words of the Text are theſe: <hi>Go ye, therefore, and Teach
all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of the Son, and of
the Holy Ghost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> will not own that the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> here
mentioned was the <hi>Outward,</hi> or <hi>Water-baptiſm:</hi> Which I will
endeavour to make very plain, that it was; and that in the firſt place,</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Signification</hi> and <hi>Etymology</hi> of the word
<hi>Baptize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The word is a <hi>Greek</hi> word, and only made
<hi>Engliſh</hi> by our conſtant uſage of it: It ſignifies to
<hi>Waſh,</hi> and is apply'd to this <hi>Sacrament</hi> of
<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> becauſe that is an outward <hi>Waſhing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>Waſh</hi> and to <hi>Baptize</hi> are the very ſame: and
if the word <hi>Baptize</hi> had been rendred into <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
inſtead of, <hi>Go and</hi> BA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PTIZE, it muſt have been ſaid, <hi>Go
and</hi> WASH <hi>Men, in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost.</hi> So that the outward <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi>
is as much here command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as if it had been expreſſed in
<hi>Engliſh</hi> words, or as we can now expreſs it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95759:6"/>But becauſe the word <hi>Baptize</hi> was grown
a Technical Term, in other Languages, whereby to expreſs the Holy Sacrament
of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> long before our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation,
therefore our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators did rightly retain the word <hi>Baptize</hi> in
this Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19. and in other Texts which ſpeak of that
<hi>Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in other places they tranſlate the word <hi>Baptize,</hi> as
<hi>Mark</hi> vii. 4. <hi>When they come from the Market</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, except they are
<hi>Baptized,</hi> which we literally tranſlate except they <hi>Waſh.</hi>
And in the ſame Verſe, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
&amp;c. The <hi>Baptiſms</hi> of <hi>Cups</hi> and <hi>Pots,</hi> &amp;c.
which we tranſlate the <hi>Waſhing</hi> of <hi>Cups</hi> and <hi>Pots.</hi>
and <hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 10. ſpeaking of theſe Legal Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>which ſtood only in Meats and Drinks, and divers Waſhings, and carnal
Ordinances,</hi> &amp;c. the word which we here tranſlate
<hi>Waſhings,</hi> is, in the Original,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Baptiſms: In Meats and
Drinks, and divers Baptiſms.</hi> And in the <hi>Vulgar Latin,</hi> the
<hi>Greek</hi> word is retained in both theſe Texts, Mark vii. 4. <hi>Niſi
Baptizentur, non Comedunt.</hi> Except they are <hi>Baptized, i. e. Waſh</hi>
their <hi>Hands,</hi> they eat not. And <hi>Baptiſmata Calicum,</hi> &amp;c.
The <hi>Baptiſms</hi> of <hi>Cups,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 10.
<hi>In Cibis &amp; Potibus, &amp; variis Baptiſmatibus;</hi> i. e. <hi>In
Meats and Drinks, and divers Baptiſms.</hi> So that it is plain that the word
<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the word <hi>Waſhing,</hi> tho' not the ſame word,
have yet the ſelf-ſame meaning.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is true, that the word <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is often taken
in a <hi>Figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>Allegorical</hi> Senſe, to mean the INWARD
BAPTISM, the <hi>Waſhing,</hi> or <hi>Cleanſing</hi> of the <hi>Heart:</hi>
But ſo is the word <hi>Waſhing</hi> alſo, as often, as <hi>Jer.</hi> iv.
14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there is ſcarce a Word in the World but is capable
of many <hi>Figurative</hi> and <hi>Allegorical</hi> Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Thus
<hi>Circumciſion</hi> is very often us'd for the <hi>Inward
Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> or <hi>Purity</hi> of the <hi>Heart.</hi> And
<hi>Fire</hi> is taken to expreſs <hi>Love,</hi> and likewiſe
<hi>Anger,</hi> and many other things.</p>
            <p>But it is a receiv'd Rule for the Interpretation of
<hi>Scripture,</hi> and indeed of all other <hi>Writings</hi> and
<hi>Words,</hi> that the plain <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral</hi> Meaning is always to be taken,
where there is no manifeſt <hi>Contradiction</hi> or <hi>Abſurdity</hi> in
it; as when a Man is ſaid to have a <hi>Fire</hi> burning in his
<hi>Breast,</hi> it cannot be meant of the <hi>Literal Fire:</hi> ſo when we
are commanded to <hi>Waſh</hi> or <hi>Circumciſe</hi> our<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95759:6"/>
               <hi>Hearts,</hi> and the like. But, on the other hand, if any Man will
take upon him to underſtand Words in a <hi>Figurative Senſe,</hi> at his
own will and pleaſure, without an apparent Neceſſity from the
<hi>Scope</hi> and <hi>Coherence,</hi> he ſets up to <hi>Banter,</hi> and
leaves no <hi>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in any <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Expreſſions</hi>
in the World. Therefore I will conclude this Point of the natural
<hi>Signification</hi> and <hi>Etymology</hi> of the word <hi>Baptize:</hi>
And, unleſs the <hi>Quakers</hi> can ſhew an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<hi>Contradiction</hi> or <hi>Abſurdity</hi> to take it in the <hi>Literal
Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> in this Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19. then it muſt
be meant of the OUTWARD WASHING or BAPTISM, becauſe that is the only
<hi>True,</hi> and <hi>Proper,</hi> and <hi>Literal</hi> Signification of the
Word.</p>
            <p>And it will be further Demonſtrated in the next <hi>Section,</hi>
that there can be no <hi>Contradiction</hi> or <hi>Abſurdity</hi> to take it
in a <hi>Literal</hi> Senſe, becauſe the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and Others
thereunto <hi>Commiſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> by them, did Practiſe it, in the
<hi>Literal</hi> Senſe.</p>

came unto John, and ſaid unto him, Rabbi, He that was with thee beyond
Jordan, to whom thou barest witneſs, Behold, the ſame Baptizeth, and all
Men come to Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this was <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> there can be no Doubt,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Baptiſm with the Holy Ghost</hi> was not yet given: For
that was not given till the Day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> fifty Days after the
<hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as it is Recorded in the Second of
the <hi>Acts.</hi> This <hi>Spiritual Baptiſm</hi> was promiſed,
<hi>John</hi> xiv. 16, 26. xv. 26. xvi. 7. And the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were
commanded to tarry in the City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> till it ſhould come
upon them, <hi>Luke</hi> xxiv. 49. 2. The <hi>Quakers</hi> allow that
<hi>John</hi> did <hi>Baptize</hi> with <hi>Water,</hi> and there is no other
ſort of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> here mentioned, with<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95759:7"/>which
<hi>Christ</hi> did <hi>Baptize;</hi> and therefore, theſe
<hi>Baptiſms</hi> being ſpoke of both together, there can be no Reaſon to
interpret the <hi>one</hi> to be with <hi>Water,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi>
not. It is ſaid <hi>John</hi> iv. 1. <hi>The Phariſees heard that Jeſus
made and baptized more Diſciples than John.</hi> How cou'd the
<hi>Phariſees</hi> hear of it, if it was not an <hi>Outward</hi> and
<hi>Viſible Baptiſm?</hi> For, as before is ſaid, the <hi>outward</hi>
and <hi>miraculous</hi> Effects of the <hi>Baptiſm with the Holy Ghost</hi>
were not then given. And ſince it Was an <hi>Outward,</hi> it muſt be the
<hi>Water-baptiſm,</hi> for there was <hi>then</hi> no other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſtart an <hi>Objection</hi>
here, That it is ſaid <hi>John</hi> iv. 2. <hi>Jeſus himſelf baptized
not, but his Diſciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Anſ. Tho Jeſus himſelf baptized not,</hi> yet it
is ſaid in the <hi>Verſe</hi> foregoing, that <hi>He made</hi> and
<hi>baptized,</hi> i. e. thoſe whom <hi>His Diſciples,</hi> by His Order,
<hi>Baptized.</hi> For, if it had not been done <hi>by His Order,</hi> it cou'd
not be ſaid that he had <hi>Baptized</hi> thoſe whom his Diſciples
<hi>Baptized.</hi> But becauſe, <hi>He that doeth a thing by Another,</hi> is
ſaid to <hi>do it Himſelf,</hi> therefore <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf is
ſaid to have <hi>Baptized</hi> thoſe, whom his Diſciples, by his Order,
did <hi>Baptize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Anſw.</hi> That <hi>Baptizing</hi> which
<hi>Christ</hi> is ſaid to have Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred <hi>himſelf, John</hi> iii.
26. might have been at another <hi>Time</hi> than that which is mentioned in
the 4th <hi>Chapter:</hi> And then the conſequence will only be this, That,
at <hi>ſome Times, Christ</hi> did Baptiſe <hi>Himſelf;</hi> and at
<hi>other Times,</hi> he left it to his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> Tho, as to our
Argument, it is the ſame thing, whether he did it <hi>Himſelf,</hi> or
commanded his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to do it. For, either way, it is <hi>his
Baptiſm, his Onely;</hi> his <hi>Diſciples</hi> did but
<hi>Adminiſter</hi> what he commanded.</p>
            <p n="2">II. As <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf did <hi>Baptize</hi> with
<hi>Water,</hi> and his <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> by his Commandment, while he was
with them upon Earth; ſo did his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and Others, thereunto
by them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated, after his <hi>Death,</hi> and
<hi>Reſurrection,</hi> by vertue of his Command to them, <hi>Matth.</hi>
xxviii. 19. after he was Riſen from the Dead.</p>
            <p>What is ſaid above of the <hi>Etymology</hi> and true
<hi>Signification</hi> of the word <hi>Baptize,</hi> is, of itſelf,
ſufficient to prove, that by <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in this <hi>Text,</hi> the
<hi>outward Baptiſm</hi> with <hi>Water</hi> is meant: eſpecially till the
<hi>Quakers</hi> can ſhew any <hi>Contradiction</hi> or <hi>Abſurdity</hi>
in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the word taken in the <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>literal</hi>
ſenſe, in this, and the other <hi>Texts</hi> which ſpeak of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95759:7"/>And this will be very hard to do, ſince, as it
is juſt now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that <hi>Christ</hi> did <hi>Baptize</hi> with
<hi>Water,</hi> as well as <hi>John.</hi> And what <hi>Abſurdity,</hi> or
<hi>Contradiction</hi> can be alledged, that his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> ſhou'd
Adminiſter the ſame ſort of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> after his <hi>Death,</hi>
as he had <hi>Practiſed</hi> and Commanded during his <hi>Life?</hi> Nay
rather, what Reaſon can be given, why they ſhou'd not be the ſame,
ſince the ſame <hi>word,</hi> i. e. <hi>Baptize,</hi> is us'd in Both, and
no new <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Acceptation</hi> of the <hi>word</hi> is ſo
much as hinted? And therefore to put any new <hi>ſenſe</hi> or
<hi>acceptation</hi> of the <hi>word,</hi> muſt be wholly <hi>Arbitrary</hi>
and <hi>Precarious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, as I promis'd, I will Demonſtrate yet more fully and plainly,
that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did <hi>Practiſe</hi> the <hi>Outward,</hi> i.
e. <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> after CHRIST's <hi>death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Acts x. 27. <hi>Can any Man forbid</hi> Water, <hi>that theſe
ſhou'd not be Baptized?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Acts viii. 36. <hi>As they</hi> (Philip <hi>and the</hi> Eunuch)
<hi>went on their way, they came to a certain</hi> Water, <hi>and the Eunuch
ſaid, See here is</hi> Water, <hi>what doth hinder me to be
Baptized?—And</hi> (Verſe 38.) <hi>they went both down into the</hi>
Water, <hi>hoth Philip and the Eunuch, and he Baptized him: And when they were
come up out of the</hi> WA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Acts xxii. 16. <hi>And now why tarriest thou? Ariſe and be
Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and</hi> waſh <hi>away thy ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, to ſave more Quotations, the <hi>Quakers</hi> do own that the
<hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 14
&amp; 17. was <hi>Water-baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore I will conclude this Point, as undeniable, That the
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> did practiſe <hi>Water-baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Argument from thence will lie thus: The <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
did practiſe that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> commanded
<hi>Mat.</hi> xxviii. 19. But the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did practiſe
<hi>Water-baptiſm;</hi> therefore <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-baptiſm</hi> was that
<hi>Baptiſm</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> commanded <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii.
19.</p>
            <p n="3">III. And, as the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of the
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> is a moſt ſure Rule whereby to underſtand the meaning
of that <hi>Command</hi> which they put in <hi>execution;</hi> ſo the
<hi>Practiſe</hi> of thoſe who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceeded the
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who were Cotemporaries with them, and learn'd the Faith
from their Mouths, is as certain a Rule to know what the <hi>Practiſe,</hi>
and what the <hi>Senſe</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95759:8"/>were.
And thus the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of the <hi>preſent Age,</hi> in the
Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of <hi>Water-baptiſm,</hi> is an undeniable Evidence, that
this was the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of the <hi>laſt Age;</hi> the ſame
Perſons being, many of them, alive in both the <hi>last</hi> and the
<hi>preſent Age.</hi> For one <hi>Age</hi> does not go off the World all at
once, and another ſucceed all of <hi>perfect Age</hi> together; but there are
<hi>old Men</hi> of the <hi>last Age,</hi> and <hi>young Men</hi> and
<hi>Children</hi> growing up to another <hi>Age</hi> all alive up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth the
ſame time; and <hi>Mankind</hi> being diſperſed into far diſtant
<hi>Countries</hi> and <hi>Climates,</hi> who know not of one another, nor hold
any Correſpondence: It is, by theſe means, morally impoſſible for any
<hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Men,</hi> to deceive us in what has been the
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> and Receiv'd <hi>Practiſe</hi> of the <hi>last
Age,</hi> to which the <hi>preſent Age</hi> is ſo linked, that it is even a
part of it: I ſay it is impoſſible for <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Fathers</hi>
of the World, to be ſuppos'd <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> or if they were, to be
<hi>capable</hi> of impoſing upon all <hi>younger</hi> than themſelves,
namely, That they had been all <hi>Baptized,</hi> and that this was an
univerſally receiv'd <hi>Cuſtom;</hi> and of which <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
were always kept, in every <hi>Pariſh,</hi> of <hi>all</hi> who had been,
from time to time, <hi>Baptized;</hi> and that ſuch <hi>Regiſters</hi> were
<hi>publick,</hi> and to be recurr'd to by all that had a mind to it: Every
Man's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will tell him that it is utterly impoſſible for ſuch a
thing to paſs upon Mankind.</p>
            <p>And as certainly as the <hi>preſent Age</hi> is thus aſſur'd
of the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe</hi> of the <hi>last Age,</hi> in a Thing of ſo
<hi>publick</hi> and <hi>univerſal</hi> a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo certainly, and by the
ſame Rules, muſt the <hi>last Age</hi> know the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of the
<hi>Age</hi> before that; and ſo backward all the way to the <hi>first
Inſtitution,</hi> to the <hi>Age</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>publick</hi> nature of this <hi>Water-baptiſm,</hi> as now
practiſed, being an <hi>outward</hi> matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> of which Mens
<hi>outward Senſes,</hi> their <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Ears</hi> are
<hi>Judges;</hi> not like Matters of <hi>Opinion,</hi> which ſort of
<hi>Tares</hi> may be <hi>privately</hi> ſown, and <hi>long time</hi>
propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, without any remarkable Diſcovery; And to this ſo
<hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> adding the <hi>univerſal</hi>
Practice of it, through all the far diſtant Nations of
<hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> I ſay theſe two <hi>Marks</hi> make it
impoſſible for the World to be impos'd upon, nor was it ever, or ever can
be impos'd upon, in any ſuch <hi>publick</hi> Matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> ſo
<hi>univerſally</hi> practiſed. All this makes it undeniably plain. That
the <hi>last Age</hi> did <hi>practiſe</hi> the ſame <hi>outward Water
ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95759:8"/>which is practis'd in <hi>this Age;</hi> and
that the ſame was, as certainly, practis'd in the <hi>Age</hi> before the
<hi>last Age,</hi> and by the ſame Rule, in the <hi>Age</hi> before that; and
ſo onward, as aboveſaid, to the <hi>Age</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> I
have made more Words of this than needed, but I wou'd render it exceeding
plain, conſidering with whom I have to do. And I beſeech them to
conſider, That all the Authority which they have to Over-ballance all theſe
Demonſtrations, is the mad <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> of a <hi>Lay-Apoſtle,
George Fox,</hi> a <hi>Mechanick</hi> ſo <hi>Illiterate,</hi> that he was
hardly Maſter of <hi>common Senſe,</hi> nor cou'd write <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
or any other Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; and ſtarted up amongſt us in the Year 1650, (the
Age of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi>) and Damn'd, as
<hi>Apoſtates,</hi> all <hi>Ages</hi> ſince the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all of which no One cou'd be found (before <hi>G. Fox</hi>) to
bear their Teſtimony againſt this <hi>Water-baptiſm,</hi> tho' it was
<hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly</hi> and <hi>univerſally</hi> practiſed; and that
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> were then ſo <hi>Zealous</hi> as to contend againſt
the leaſt Variation or Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Faith,</hi> even unto
<hi>Death,</hi> and the moſt cruel ſort of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can any Man imagin, that if <hi>Water-baptiſm</hi> were a
<hi>Human Invention,</hi> or <hi>Superſtitiouſly</hi> either
<hi>Continu'd</hi> or <hi>Obtruded</hi> upon the <hi>Church,</hi> no One
ſhou'd be found, for 1650 Years, to open his Mouth againſt it; when
<hi>Thouſands</hi> ſacrific'd their <hi>Lives,</hi> for Matters of much
leſs Importance?</p>
            <p>But I have over-labour'd this Point, to any Man who will give
himſelf leave to make uſe of his Reaſon. Therefore I will proceed to the
next <hi>Section.</hi>

            <head>SECT. III. That <hi>Baptiſm</hi> must be <hi>Outward</hi> and
<hi>Viſible,</hi> becauſe it is an Ordinance appointed whereby to
<hi>Initiate</hi> Men into an <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Viſible Society,</hi>
which is the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THere goes no more towards the proving of this, than to ſhew,
1ſt, That the <hi>Church</hi> is an <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Viſible
So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> 2dly, That <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was appointed and us'd for
<hi>Initiating</hi> or <hi>Admitting</hi> Men into the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95759:9"/>1ſt, That the <hi>Church</hi> is an
<hi>outward</hi> and <hi>viſible</hi> Society. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> calls it,
<hi>A City that is ſet on a Hill,</hi> (Matth. v. 14.) The <hi>Quakers</hi>
themſelves are an <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>viſible Society;</hi> and ſo
are all thoſe who bear the Name of <hi>Churches</hi> upon Earth. They cou'd
not otherwiſe be <hi>Churches.</hi> For that implies a <hi>Society</hi> of
<hi>People;</hi> and every <hi>Society</hi> in the World, is an
<hi>outward</hi> and <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Thing.</p>
            <p>And, as it is ſo, has an <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>viſible
Form</hi> of Admitting Men into it: For otherwiſe it wou'd not be known who
are <hi>Members</hi> of it. Every <hi>Society</hi> is <hi>Excluſive</hi> of
all others who are not of that <hi>Society;</hi> otherwiſe it cou'd not be a
<hi>Society:</hi> for that ſuppoſes the Men of that <hi>Society,</hi> to be
thereby diſtinguiſhed from other Men: And that ſuppoſes as much that
there muſt be ſome <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>viſible</hi> Form whereby to
<hi>Initiate</hi> Men, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title them to be <hi>Members</hi> of ſuch a
<hi>Society:</hi> otherwiſe it cou'd not be known who were <hi>Members</hi>
of it, and who were not; and it wou'd thereby <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ceaſe to
be a <hi>Society;</hi> for it cou'd not then be diſtinguiſhed from the
reſt of Mankind: as a <hi>River</hi> is loſt in the <hi>Sea,</hi> becauſe
it is no longer diſtinguiſh'd from it, but goes to make up a part of
it.</p>
            <p>From hence it appears, that the <hi>Church,</hi> being an
<hi>outward</hi> and <hi>viſible Society,</hi> muſt have ſome
<hi>outward</hi> and <hi>viſible Form</hi> to <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate</hi> Men, and
make them <hi>Members</hi> of that <hi>Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly, That <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was that <hi>outward Form.</hi>
All the ſeveral <hi>Baptiſms</hi> that were before <hi>Christ's,</hi> were
all meant for <hi>Initiating Forms.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> had a Cuſtom long
before <hi>Christ,</hi> to <hi>initiate</hi> the <hi>Proſelites</hi> or
<hi>Converts</hi> to their Religion, not only by <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> but
by <hi>Baptizing,</hi> or <hi>Waſhing</hi> them with <hi>Water.</hi> The
ſame was the meaning of <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> to make Men his
<hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples.</hi> And the ſame was the meaning of <hi>Christ's
Baptiſm,</hi> to <hi>initiate</hi> Men into the <hi>Chriſtian
Religion,</hi> and make them <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence <hi>Baptizing</hi> Men, and making them <hi>Diſciples,</hi>
mean the ſame thing. Thus <hi>John</hi> iv. 1. it is ſaid, That <hi>Jeſus
made and baptized more Diſciples than John.</hi> That is, be
<hi>baptized</hi> them <hi>Diſciples,</hi> which was the <hi>Form</hi> of
<hi>Making</hi> them ſuch. If any will ſay, that he <hi>baptized</hi> them
to be <hi>Diſciples</hi> to <hi>John,</hi> that will be anſwer'd
<hi>Sect.</hi> VI. But as to the preſent Point, it is the ſame 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95759:9"/>thing whoſe <hi>Diſciples</hi> they were made; for we are
now only to ſhew that <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> in the general, was an
<hi>Initiating Form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when <hi>Christ</hi> practiſed it, as well as <hi>John,</hi>
as this Text does expreſly declare, no Reaſon can be given that he did not
uſe it as an <hi>Initiating Form,</hi> as well as <hi>John;</hi> eſpecially
when the Text does expreſs that he did <hi>make</hi> them
<hi>Diſciples,</hi> by <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi> of them, as above is ſhewn.</p>
            <p>And purſuant to this, when <hi>Christ</hi> ſent his
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> to convert <hi>all Nations,</hi> his Commiſſion of
<hi>Baptizing</hi> was as large as that of <hi>Teaching,</hi> Matth. xxviii.
19. <hi>Go</hi> TEACH <hi>all Nations,</hi> BAPTIZING <hi>them,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>i. e. Baptizing</hi> all who ſhall receive your word. And accordingly it
is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 41. <hi>They that received the word were
baptized.</hi> Purſuant to what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had preached to them
<hi>Verſe</hi> 28. <hi>Repent and be baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And accordingly we find it the conſtant Cuſtom to
<hi>baptize</hi> all that were converted to the <hi>Faith.</hi> Thus
<hi>Paul,</hi> tho <hi>miraculouſly</hi> converted from <hi>Heaven,</hi> was
commanded to be <hi>baptized,</hi> Acts xxii. 16. And he <hi>baptized
Lydia,</hi> and the <hi>Jaylor,</hi> and their Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, as ſoon as he
had converted them, <hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 15, 33. And the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
Acts xviii. 8. And the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> who had not yet
been made <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> Acts xix. 5. <hi>Philip</hi> did
<hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize</hi> the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> as ſoon as he believed in
<hi>Christ,</hi> Acts viii. 37, 38. And <hi>Peter,</hi> immediately upon the
Converſion of <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and thoſe with him, ſaid, <hi>Can any
Man forbid Water, that theſe ſhou'd not be baptized?</hi> Acts x. 47.</p>
            <p>It wou'd be endleſs to enumerate all the like Inſtances of
<hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,</hi> in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> And it was always us'd as
an <hi>Initiating Form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly, <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was not only an <hi>Initiating
Form:</hi> But it ſerv'd for nothing elſe. For it was never to be
<hi>repeated.</hi> As a Man can be <hi>born</hi> but <hi>once</hi> into this
World, ſo he can be but <hi>once regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> or <hi>born</hi> into the
<hi>Church;</hi> which is therefore, in <hi>Scripture,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>New
Birth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid of the other Sacrament (of the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi>)
<hi>as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as ye eat this Bread,</hi> &amp;c. I Cor. xi. 26. This was to be
<hi>often</hi> repeated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is our <hi>Admiſſion, Initiation,</hi> or
<hi>Birth</hi> into the <hi>Society</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and
accordingly <hi>once only</hi> to be adminiſtred. The<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95759:10"/>
               <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> is our <hi>Nouriſhment</hi> and <hi>Daily
Food</hi> in it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be <hi>often</hi> repeated.</p>
            <p>And as of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s, ſo of other <hi>Baptiſms,</hi>
of <hi>John</hi>'s, and the <hi>Jews,</hi> they being only <hi>Initiating
Forms,</hi> they were not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> did not
<hi>baptize</hi> their <hi>Proſelites</hi> more than <hi>once.</hi> And
<hi>John</hi> did not <hi>baptize</hi> his <hi>Diſciples</hi> more than
<hi>once.</hi> So neither were Men <hi>twice baptized</hi> into the
<hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> more than they were <hi>twice Circumciſed,</hi>
or <hi>Admitted</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus having proved, 1ſt, That the <hi>Church</hi> is an
<hi>outward</hi> and <hi>viſible</hi> Society. 2dly, That <hi>Baptiſm</hi>
was the <hi>Initiating Form</hi> of <hi>Admitting</hi> Men into that
<hi>Society.</hi> 3dly, That it was only an <hi>Initiating Form.</hi> I think
the Conſequence is undeniable, that this <hi>Baptiſm</hi> muſt be an
<hi>outward</hi> and <hi>viſible Form:</hi> Becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it cou'd
be no <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Badge</hi> of an Admiſſion into an
<hi>outward</hi> and <hi>viſible</hi> Society; for ſuch a <hi>Badge</hi>
muſt be as <hi>outward</hi> as the <hi>Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Acts of <hi>inward Faith</hi> are, and ought to be <hi>often
repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> Therefore this <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which cou'd not be
<hi>repeated,</hi> cou'd not be the <hi>inward,</hi> but the <hi>outward</hi>
Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>And thus having prov'd <hi>that Baptiſm</hi> commanded
<hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19. to be the <hi>outward,</hi> that is,
<hi>Water-baptiſm:</hi> 1ſt, From the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper
Etymology</hi> and <hi>Signification</hi> of the <hi>Word.</hi> 2dly, From the
<hi>Practiſe</hi> of CHRIST, and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the whole
<hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> after them. And, 3dly, From the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the
<hi>Thing; Baptiſm</hi> being an Ordinance appointed only for
<hi>Initiating</hi> Men into an <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>viſible
Society;</hi> and therefore never to be <hi>repeated:</hi> Having thus prov'd
our Concluſion from ſuch plain, eaſie, and certain Topicks; I will now
proceed to thoſe Objections (ſuch as they are) which the <hi>Quakers</hi>
do ſet up againſt all theſe clear Demonſtrations. And ſhall
according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the firſt place, take notice of their <hi>groundleſs
Pretence</hi> in making <hi>that</hi> BAPTISM commanded in the <hi>Holy
Goſpel,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an ORDINANCE <hi>external</hi> and
<hi>viſible,</hi> to be underſtood only of the <hi>Inward</hi> and
<hi>Spiritual</hi> BAPTISM, not with WATER, but the HOLY GHOST.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THey <hi>ſay</hi> this; and that is all. They neither pretend to

<hi>Aſſertion.</hi> Only they <hi>ſay ſo;</hi> and they <hi>will</hi>
believe it; and there is an End of it.</p>
            <p>And truly there ſhou'd be an End of it, if only
<hi>Diſputation,</hi> or <hi>Victory</hi> were my Deſign: For to what

            </p>
            <p>But becauſe the Pains I have taken is only in Charity for their
Souls, I will over-look all their Impertinency, and deal with them as with
weyward Children, humour them, and follow them thro' all their
<hi>Windings</hi> and <hi>Turnings;</hi> and ſubmit to <hi>over-prove,</hi>
what is abundantly <hi>proved</hi> already. Therefore, ſince they can give no
Reaſon why <hi>that Baptiſm</hi> commanded <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19.
ſhou'd be meant <hi>only</hi> of the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with the <hi>Holy
Ghost;</hi> and wou'd be content that we ſhou'd leave them there, as
obſtinate Men, and purſue them no further; but let them perſwade thoſe
whom they can perſwade: By which Method (unhappily yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them) they
have gain'd and ſecur'd moſt of their <hi>Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> by keeping
them from <hi>Diſputing</hi> or <hi>Reaſoning;</hi> and by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
them to hearken only to their own <hi>Light within:</hi> To Reſcue them out
of this Snare, I will be content to undertake the <hi>Negative</hi> (though
againſt the Rules of Argument,) and to prove, that the <hi>Baptiſm</hi>
commanded <hi>Matth.</hi> xxviii. 19. was not the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with the
<hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt, To <hi>baptize</hi> with the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is
peculiar to <hi>Christ</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. For none can <hi>baptize</hi> with the
<hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> but who can <hi>ſend</hi> and <hi>beſtow</hi> the
<hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Which is <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> to aſcribe to any
Creature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:95759:11"/>
               <hi>Christ</hi> has indeed committed the
Adminiſtration of the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Baptiſm</hi> with <hi>Water</hi> to his
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and to Others by them thereunto <hi>ordained;</hi> and has
promiſed the <hi>inward Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to thoſe
who ſhall <hi>daly</hi> receive the <hi>outward Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this cannot give the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or any other
<hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> the Title of <hi>baptizing</hi> with
the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> though the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> may be given by their
<hi>Miniſtration.</hi> For they are not the <hi>Givers,</hi> that is
<hi>Blaſphemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And purſuant to this, it is obſervable, that none is ever
ſaid, in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> to <hi>baptize with the Holy Ghost</hi> but
<hi>Christ</hi> alone: <hi>The ſame is he who baptizeth with the Holy
Ghost,</hi> John i. 33.</p>
            <p>And therefore, if that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> commanded <hi>Matth.</hi>
xxviii. 19. was the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> it wou'd
follow that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> cou'd <hi>baptize</hi> with the <hi>Holy

            <p n="2">2dly, It is written, <hi>John</hi> iv. 2. That <hi>Jeſus
himſelf baptized not, but his Diſciples.</hi> If this was not meant of
<hi>Water-baptiſm,</hi> but of the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> with the <hi>Holy

with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> but that his <hi>Diſciples</hi> did.</p>
            <p>This, in ſhort, may ſuffice in return to a <hi>meer

            <head>SECT. V. The great Argument of the <hi>Quakers</hi> against

it. Yet ſince they do inſiſt upon it, let them take this eaſie
Anſwer: That<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95759:11"/>
               <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Water-baptiſm</hi> is
<hi>ceaſed;</hi> but not <hi>Christ's Water-baptiſm.</hi> All <hi>outward
Baptiſms</hi> were <hi>Water-baptiſms,</hi> as the word <hi>Baptiſm</hi>
ſignifies, (<hi>See</hi> Sect. I.) The <hi>Jews Baptiſm</hi> was
<hi>Water-baptiſm,</hi> as well as <hi>John</hi>'s. And by this Argument of
<hi>Barclay</hi>'s, the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>John</hi>'s may be prov'd to be
the ſame. Thus. The <hi>Jews Baptiſm</hi> was <hi>Water-baptiſm:</hi> but
<hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was <hi>Water-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm:</hi> therefore
<hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was the <hi>Jews Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus, <hi>Christ's Baptiſm</hi> was <hi>John</hi>'s, and
<hi>John</hi>'s was the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> was
<hi>Christ's;</hi> and they were <hi>all</hi> one and the ſelf-ſame
<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> becauſe they were all <hi>Water-baptiſms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So without all Foundation is this great Rock of the
<hi>Quakers,</hi> upon which they build their main Battery againſt
<hi>Water-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> It will be proper here to let them ſee (if
they be not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ignorant) What it is which makes the Difference of
<hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſms:</hi> not the <hi>outward Matter</hi> in which they are
adminiſtred (for that may be the ſame in many <hi>Baptiſms,</hi> as is
ſhewn.) But <hi>Baptiſms</hi> do differ, 1. In their <hi>Authors.</hi> 2.
In the different <hi>Form,</hi> in which they are adminiſtred. 3. In the
different <hi>Ends</hi> for which they were inſtituted.</p>
            <p>And in all theſe the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> does
differ vaſtly from the <hi>Baptiſms</hi> both of <hi>John</hi> and the
<hi>Jews,</hi> 1. As to the <hi>Author:</hi> The <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of the
<hi>Jews</hi> was an Addition of their own to the Law; and had no higher
<hi>Author</hi> that we know of. But <hi>John</hi> was ſent by <hi>God,</hi>
to <hi>baptize,</hi> John i. 33. And it was <hi>Christ the Lord</hi> who was
the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Baptiſm.</hi> 2. As to the
<hi>Form:</hi> Perſons were <hi>baptized</hi> unto thoſe whoſe
<hi>Diſciples</hi> they were admitted by their <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> Thus the
<hi>Proſelites</hi> to the <hi>Jewiſh Religion,</hi> were <hi>baptized</hi>
unto <hi>Moſes.</hi> And Men were made <hi>Diſciples</hi> to <hi>John,</hi>
by his <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> But the <hi>Chriſtian Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm</hi> alone is
adminiſtred <hi>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost.</hi> This is the <hi>Form</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Baptiſm,</hi>
and which does diſtinguiſh it from all other <hi>Baptiſms</hi> whatever.
3. The <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Baptiſm</hi> is as highly
<hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> and <hi>different</hi> from the <hi>Ends</hi> of other
<hi>Baptiſms,</hi> as their <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> differ. The <hi>End</hi> of the
<hi>Jewiſh Baptiſm</hi> was to give the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized</hi> a Title to the
<hi>Priviledges</hi> of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And the <hi>End</hi> of
<hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was to point to HIM who was to come; and to
prepare Men, by <hi>Repentance,</hi> for the Reception of the
<hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi> 
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95759:12"/>But the <hi>End</hi> of CHRIST<hi>'s
Baptiſm</hi> was to Inſtate Us into all the Unconceivable <hi>Glories,</hi>
and High Eternal <hi>Prerogatives</hi> which belong to the <hi>Members of his
Body, of his Fleſh, and of his Bones,</hi> Eph. v. 30. <hi>That we might
receive the Adoption of Sons,</hi> Gal. iv. 5. Henceforth no more
<hi>Servants,</hi> but <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>God!</hi> and <hi>Heirs</hi> of
<hi>Heaven!</hi> Theſe are <hi>Ends</hi> ſo far tranſcendent above the
<hi>Ends</hi> of all former <hi>Baptiſms,</hi> that, in compariſon, other
<hi>Baptiſms</hi> are not only <hi>leſs,</hi> but <hi>none at all;</hi>
like the Glory of the <hi>Stars,</hi> in preſence of the <hi>Sun;</hi> they
not only are a <hi>leſſer</hi> Light, but when he appears, they become

            </p>
            <p>And as a <hi>Pledge</hi> or <hi>Fore-taſte</hi> of theſe

of the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> As <hi>Peter</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

<hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and of <hi>John</hi> were not the

<hi>Diſciples</hi> had told him of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> out ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valling him, by
<hi>baptizing</hi> more than he, <hi>John</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>He muſt
increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe,</hi> John iii. 30. But if CHRIST did
<hi>ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize</hi> with the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> than
<hi>John</hi> ſtill <hi>increaſed,</hi> and CHRIST <hi>decreaſed.</hi>
For,</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, He is <hi>greater</hi> who <hi>inſtitutes</hi> a
<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> than thoſe who only <hi>adminiſter</hi> a
<hi>Baptiſm</hi> of another's appointment: Therefore if <hi>Chriſt</hi> did
<hi>baptize</hi> with the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> it argues
<hi>John</hi> to be <hi>greater</hi> than <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and
<hi>Chriſt</hi> to be but a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly, All the <hi>Jews</hi> who had been <hi>baptized</hi>
with the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> did not turn
<hi>Chriſtians;</hi> therefore <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was not the

            </p>
            <p>To all theſe clear Arguments the <hi>Quakers,</hi> without

<hi>Water-baptiſm</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did adminiſter, was no
other than <hi>John</hi>'s Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm. That they had no Command for it; only
did it in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> circumcis'd
<hi>Timothy,</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 3.) And purify'd himſelf in the
<hi>Temple,</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> xxi. 21, <hi>to</hi> 27.) But this is all
<hi>Gratis Dictum;</hi> here is not one word of <hi>Proof:</hi> And they might
as well ſay, That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> PREACHING was only in Compliance
with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that it was the ſame with <hi>John</hi>'s
PREACHING; for their Commiſſions to <hi>Teach,</hi> and to

            <p>I Anſwer: That <hi>Teaching</hi> was the Method whereby to

give him the <hi>Priviledges</hi> and <hi>Benefits</hi> of a

            </p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> being ſent to <hi>Teach</hi> Men, in

            <p>But, as a <hi>Child</hi> is <hi>Admitted</hi> into a <hi>School</hi>

Which ſhews the meaning of theſe two Words, <hi>i. e. Diſcipling,</hi>

(without any ground or appearance of Truth) That theſe Words were an Anſwer
to a Queſtion. And that the Queſtion was, Whether they might not be
Baptized with <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm? And that this proceeded from a
Fondneſs the <hi>Jews</hi> had to <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm. And that the
Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> only Comply'd with them out of Condeſcention, as

to have had any Longing after <hi>John</hi>'s Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm; none of them having

think that <hi>Peter</hi> wou'd have <hi>Comply'd</hi> with him; and not rather
have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd</hi> him, and carry'd him beyond it, to the
<hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Christ:</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> did (<hi>Acts</hi>

<hi>John?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. But as to the <hi>Complyance</hi> which the
<hi>Quakers</hi> wou'd have to <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> and which
they compare to <hi>Paul</hi>'s Complyance in <hi>Circumciſing</hi> Timothy:
I will ſhew the great Diſparity.</p>
            <p n="1">Firſt, The <hi>Law</hi> was more univerſally receiv'd than
<hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> For <hi>many</hi> and the <hi>Chief</hi> of
the <hi>Jews</hi> did not receive <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as
above-obſerv'd.</p>
            <p n="2">Secondly, The Law was of much longer ſtanding:
<hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was like a <hi>Flaſh</hi> of
<hi>Lightning,</hi> like the <hi>Day-Star,</hi> which uſher'd in the
<hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and then diſappear'd: But the
<hi>Law</hi> continu'd during the long <hi>Night</hi> of <hi>Types</hi> and
<hi>Shadows,</hi> many <hi>hundreds</hi> of <hi>Years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">Thirdly, <hi>John</hi> did no <hi>Miracle</hi> (<hi>John</hi>
x. 41.) But the <hi>Law</hi> was delivered, and propagated by many
<hi>Ages</hi> of <hi>Miracles.</hi> 'Twas enjoyn'd under Penalty of
<hi>Death,</hi> to them and their <hi>Poſterities;</hi> whereas
<hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm</hi> laſted not one Age, was intended only for
the Men then preſent, to point out to them the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> then
already come, and ready to appear: And no outward <hi>Penalties</hi> were
annexed to <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Law;</hi> People were only <hi>Invited,</hi> not
<hi>Compell'd</hi> to come unto his <hi>Baptiſm:</hi> But to neglect
<hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,</hi> was <hi>Death,</hi> Gen. xvii. 14. Exod. iv. 24.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Preaching</hi> of <hi>John</hi> was only a <hi>Warning;</hi>
let thoſe take notice to it that wou'd:</p>
            <p>Whereas the <hi>Law</hi> was pronounced by the Mouth of <hi>God</hi>
Himſelf, in <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning,</hi> and out of the midſt
of the <hi>Fire,</hi> upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in the Audience of all the
People: <hi>And ſo terrible was the Sight, that</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid, I
exceedingly fear<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95759:17"/>and quake,</hi> Heb. xii. 21. For <hi>from
God's Right Hand went a Fire of Law for them,</hi> Deut. xxxiii. 2.</p>
            <p>From all theſe Reaſons, we muſt ſuppoſe the <hi>Jews</hi>
to be much more Tenacious of the <hi>Law,</hi> than of <hi>John</hi>'s
<hi>Baptiſm;</hi> and to be brought off with greater difficulty from their
<hi>Circumciſion,</hi> which had deſcended down to them all the way from
<hi>Abraham,</hi> 430 Years before the <hi>Law,</hi> (Gal. iii. 17.) than from
<hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,</hi> which was but of Yeſterday; and never
receiv'd by the Chief of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And therefore there was much more
reaſon for <hi>Paul</hi>'s Complying with the <hi>Jews</hi> in the Caſe of
<hi>Circumciſion,</hi> than in that of <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as
the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſuppoſe.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Christ</hi> came to fulfil the <hi>Law,</hi> he did it with
all regard to the <hi>Law,</hi> (Matth. v. 17, 18, 19.) He <hi>deſtroy'd</hi>
it not with <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> all at once; but <hi>fulfill'd</hi> it
<hi>leaſurely</hi> and by <hi>degrees: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t cum honore Mater Synagoga
ſepeliretur.</hi> The <hi>Synagogue</hi> was the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of the
<hi>Church;</hi> and therefore it was fitting that ſhe ſhou'd be
<hi>Bury'd</hi> with all <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Reaſon of all thoſe <hi>Complyances</hi> with the
<hi>Jews,</hi> at the <hi>beginning,</hi> to wear them off, by degrees, from
their <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition</hi> to the <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' in this ſome might Comply too far: And there want not thoſe
who think that <hi>Paul</hi>'s Circumciſing of <hi>Timothy,</hi> (Acts xvi.
3.) was as <hi>faulty</hi> a <hi>Complyance,</hi> as that which he blam'd in
<hi>Peter,</hi> (Gal. ii.) For that of <hi>Paul</hi>'s is not Commended, in the
Place where it is mentioned.</p>
            <p>And now I appeal to the Reaſon of Mankind, whether Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
thus pick'd up from ſuch <hi>obſcure</hi> and <hi>uncertain</hi>
Paſſages, ought to overballance <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>poſitive
Commands,</hi> which are both back'd and explain'd by the <hi>Practiſe</hi>
of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church</hi> after them?
All which I have before De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated of <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. But however the <hi>Quakers</hi> may argue from
<hi>Paul</hi>'s Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Reader</hi> has
reaſon to complain of my <hi>Complyance</hi> with <hi>Them:</hi> For, after
all that has been ſaid, there is not one ſingle Word in any Text of the
<hi>N.T.</hi> that does ſo much as hint at any ſuch thing, as that
<hi>Peter</hi>'s Baptizing of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi> or <hi>Philip</hi>'s
Baptizing of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> was in any ſort of <hi>Complyance</hi> unto
<hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> This is a perfect Figment, out of the
<hi>Quaker</hi>'s own Brain, without any Ground or Foundation 
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95759:17"/>in the World: And therefore there was no need of
Anſwering it at all, otherwiſe than to bid the <hi>Quakers</hi> prove their
<hi>Aſſertion,</hi> That theſe <hi>Baptiſms</hi> were in Complyance
with <hi>John</hi>'s, which they cou'd never, have done.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is plain from the Words of the Text, (<hi>Acts</hi> xvi.
3.) that <hi>Paul</hi>'s Circumciſing <hi>Timothy,</hi> was in Complyance
with the <hi>Jews:</hi> It is expreſly ſo ſaid, and the Reaſon of it
given, becauſe, tho' his <hi>Mother</hi> was a <hi>Jeweſs,</hi> yet his
<hi>Father</hi> was a <hi>Greek;</hi> and therefore, <hi>becauſe of the</hi>
Jews <hi>which were in thoſe Quarters</hi> (ſays the Text) he Circumciſed
<hi>Timothy,</hi> that theſe <hi>Jews</hi> might <hi>Hear</hi> and
<hi>Receive</hi> him, which, otherwiſe, they wou'd not have done. Now let the
<hi>Quakers</hi> ſhew the like Authority, that the <hi>Baptiſms</hi> of
<hi>Cornelius,</hi> of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
Acts xviii. 8. (For that too they acknowledge to have been
<hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> as I will ſhew preſently) let the
<hi>Quakers</hi> ſhew the like Authority, as I have given for the
<hi>Circumciſion</hi> of <hi>Timothy</hi> being in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance</hi> with
the <hi>Jews,</hi> let them ſhew the like, Iſay, that the foreſaid
<hi>Baptiſms</hi> were in <hi>Complyance</hi> with <hi>John</hi>'s, and then
they will have ſomething to ſay. But till then, this <hi>Excuſe,</hi> or

            <head>SECT. VII. The <hi>Quakers</hi> Maſter-Objection from 1

<hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpus</hi> and <hi>Gaius.</hi> And <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. For Christ ſent
me not to Baptize, but to Preach the Goſpel.</head>
            <p>FROM this Paſſage they argue, That <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> was
not commanded by <hi>Christ,</hi> becauſe here St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, That
he was not ſent to <hi>Baptize;</hi> and that he thanks God, that he
<hi>Baptiz'd</hi> ſo few of them. But,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:95759:18"/>In Anſwer to this, I will firſt of all
premiſe, That a bare <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> without ſome <hi>Proof</hi> on
the other ſide, does neither ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie <hi>their</hi> Cauſe, nor
overthrow <hi>ours:</hi> For when a thing is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> it
cannot be overthrown by <hi>Negative</hi> Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which may be
Objected.</p>
            <p>You muſt diſſolve the <hi>Proofs</hi> which are brought to
ſupport it: Nothing elſe will do.</p>
            <p>For what <hi>Truth</hi> is there ſo evident in the World,
againſt which no Objection can be rais'd?</p>
            <p>Even the Being of a <hi>God</hi> has been diſputed againſt by
theſe ſort of Arguments; that is, by raiſing <hi>Objections,</hi> and
ſtarting <hi>Difficulties,</hi> which may not eaſily be Anſwer'd: But
while thoſe Demonſtrative Arguments, which <hi>Prove</hi> a <hi>God,</hi>
remain unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, a thouſand <hi>Difficulties</hi> are no
<hi>Diſproof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo, while the <hi>Command</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the
<hi>Practiſe</hi> of his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and of all the <hi>Chriſtian
World,</hi> in purſuance of that Command, are clearly <hi>Prov'd,</hi> no
<hi>Difficulty</hi> from an obſcure Text, can ſhake ſuch a
Foundation.</p>
            <p>But I lay down this, only as a General Rule; becauſe this Method
is ſo much made uſe of by the <hi>Quakers</hi> (and others) who never think
of Anſwering plain <hi>Proofs;</hi> but by raiſing a great <hi>Dust</hi> of
<hi>Objections,</hi> wou'd <hi>bury</hi> and <hi>hide</hi> what they cannot
<hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay, that I only mind them at preſent, of this fallacious
Artifice; for I have no uſe for it as to theſe <hi>Texts</hi> objected, to
which a very plain and eaſie Anſwer can be given. And,</p>
            <p n="1">Firſt, I would obſerve, how the <hi>Quakers</hi> can
underſtand the Word <hi>Baptize</hi> to mean <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> or
<hi>no Water-Baptiſm,</hi> juſt as the <hi>Texts</hi> ſeem to favour
their cauſe, or otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>For there is no mention of <hi>Water</hi> in either of the
<hi>Texts</hi> obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, only the ſingle word <hi>Baptize.</hi> And why then
muſt they conſtrue theſe <hi>two</hi> Texts only, of all the reſt in
the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to mean <hi>Water-Baptiſm?</hi> Why? but only
to ſtrain an Objection out of them againſt <hi>Water-Baptiſm?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But will they let the Word <hi>Baptize</hi> ſignifie
<hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> in other places, as well as in theſe?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:95759:18"/>They cannot refuſe it with any ſhew or
colour of Reaſon. They muſt not refuſe it in <hi>Acts</hi> xviii. 8.
where the <hi>Baptizing</hi> of <hi>Criſpus</hi> (mention'd in the firſt of
the <hi>Texts</hi> objected) is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And there, it is not only ſaid of
<hi>Criſpus,</hi> that he was <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi> but that <hi>many of
the</hi> Corinthians <hi>hearing, believed, and were baptized.</hi> By which,
the <hi>Quakers</hi> cannot deny <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> to be meant, ſince
they conſtrue it ſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 14.</p>
            <p n="2">Secondly, We may further obſerve, that in the Text,
<hi>Acts</hi> xviii. 8. <hi>Criſpus</hi> is only ſaid to have
<hi>believed,</hi> which was thought ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to infer, that he was
<hi>baptized;</hi> which cou'd not be, unleſs all that <hi>believed,</hi>
were <hi>baptized:</hi> Which, no doubt, was the Caſe, as it is written,
<hi>Acts</hi> xiii. 48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal Life,
believed.</hi> And (Ch. ii. 41.) <hi>They that received the Word, were
baptized,</hi> And (V. 47.) <hi>The Lord added to the Church daily ſuch as
ſhou'd be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that this is the <hi>Climax</hi> or <hi>Scale</hi> of
<hi>Religion.</hi> As many as are ordained to eternal Life do <hi>believe:</hi>
And they that <hi>believe,</hi> are <hi>baptized:</hi> And they that are
<hi>baptized,</hi> are added to the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to ſhew this received Notion, That whoever did
<hi>believe</hi> was <hi>baptized,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> met ſome
<hi>Diſciples</hi> who had not heard of the <hi>Holy Ghost, Acts</hi> xix. 3.
he did not ask them whether they had been <hi>baptized,</hi> or not? He took
that for granted, ſince they <hi>believed.</hi> But he asks, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto what
were ye baptized?</hi> Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that they had been <hi>baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">Thirdly, Here then this <hi>Objection</hi> of the
<hi>Quakers,</hi> has turn'd into an invincible <hi>Argument</hi> againſt
them.</p>
            <p>They have, by this, yielded the whole Cauſe: For if the
<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> 1 Cor. i. 14. be <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> then that
<hi>Baptiſm, Acts</hi> xviii. 8. muſt be the ſame: And conſequently all
the other <hi>Baptiſms,</hi> mention'd in the <hi>Acts,</hi> are, as theſe,
<hi>Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>But, beſides the <hi>Quakers</hi> Confeſſion (for they are
unconſtant, and may change their Minds) the thing ſhews it ſelf, that the
<hi>Baptiſm</hi> mention'd, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 14. was
<hi>Water-Baptiſm;</hi> becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> there <hi>thanks God, that he
baptized none of them but</hi> Criſpus <hi>and</hi> Gaius. Wou'd the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> thank God that he had baptized<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95759:19"/>ſo
<hi>few,</hi> with the <hi>Holy Ghost?</hi> Or wou'd he repent of baptizing
with the <hi>Holy Ghost?</hi> Therefore it muſt be the
<hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> which was here ſpoke of.</p>
            <p n="4">Fourthly, But now, what is the Reaſon, that he was glad he
had <hi>baptized</hi> ſo <hi>few</hi> with <hi>Water-Baptiſm?</hi> And he
gives the Reaſon, in the very next words. (V. 15.) <hi>Lest any ſhou'd
ſay, that I had baptized in mine own Name.</hi> What was the occaſion of
this Fear? It is told from <hi>V.</hi> 10. That there were great
<hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions</hi> and <hi>Contentions</hi> among theſe
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> and that theſe were grounded upon the Aemulation that
aroſe among them, in behalf of their ſeveral <hi>Teachers.</hi> One was for
<hi>Paul,</hi> another for <hi>Apollos,</hi> others for <hi>Cephas,</hi> and
others for <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This wou'd ſeem, as if the Chriſtian Religion had been
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to it ſelf:</p>
            <p>As it <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and
<hi>Apollos</hi> had ſet up againſt one another:</p>
            <p>As if they had not all taught the ſame Doctrine:</p>
            <p>As if each had preach'd up <hi>himſelf,</hi> and not
<hi>Christ:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And had <hi>baptized</hi> Diſciples, each in <hi>his own
Name,</hi> and not in <hi>Chriſt's;</hi> and had begot Followers to
<hi>himſelf,</hi> and not to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To remove this ſo horrible a Scandal, St. <hi>Paul</hi> argues
with great zeal, (V. 13.) <hi>Is Christ divided?</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Was</hi>
Paul <hi>Crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in the Name of</hi> Paul? <hi>I
thank God, that I baptized none of you but</hi> Criſpus <hi>and</hi> Gaius;
<hi>leſt any ſhould ſay, That I had baptiz'd in mine own Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There needs no Application of this, the Words of the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> are themſelves ſo plain.</p>
            <p>He did not thank God, that they had not been <hi>baptized;</hi> but
that <hi>He</hi> had not done it.</p>
            <p>And this, not for any ſlight to <hi>Water-Baptiſm;</hi> but to
obviate the Objection of his <hi>baptizing</hi> in <hi>his own Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">Fifthly, By the way, this is a ſtrong Argument for
<hi>Water-Baptiſm:</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Inward Baptiſm</hi> of the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> cometh not with <hi>Obſervation</hi> and <hi>Shew,</hi> but
is <hi>within</hi> us, <hi>Luk.</hi> xvii. 20, 21. Nor is it done in any Body's
<hi>Name,</hi> it is an <hi>inward</hi> Operation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95759:19"/>But the <hi>outward Baptiſm</hi> is always
done in ſome <hi>Name</hi> or other; in his <hi>Name</hi> whoſe
<hi>Diſciple</hi> you are <hi>thereby</hi> made and <hi>Admitted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it muſt, of neceſſity, be the <hi>outward
Baptiſm,</hi> of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks; becauſe it was
<hi>outwardly</hi> Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, in ſuch an <hi>outward Name.</hi> And he
makes this an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he had not made <hi>Diſciples</hi> to
<hi>himſelf,</hi> but to <hi>Christ;</hi> becauſe he did not
<hi>Baptize</hi> them in <hi>his own Name,</hi> but in <hi>Christ</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>Now this had been no <hi>Argument,</hi> but perfect <hi>Banter,</hi>
if there had been no <hi>outward Baptiſm,</hi> that the People cou'd have
both <hi>ſeen</hi> and <hi>heard.</hi> How otherwiſe cou'd they tell in
what <hi>Name,</hi> or <hi>no Name</hi> they were <hi>baptized,</hi> if all was
<hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I need not prove what the <hi>Quakers</hi> grant and contend
for, that all this was meant of <hi>Water-Baptiſm;</hi> becauſe otherwiſe
their whole Objection, from this place, does fall.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. But they wou'd infer as if no great ſtreſs were laid
upon it; becauſe that <hi>few</hi> were ſo <hi>baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer. That there is nothing in the <hi>Text</hi> which does
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that <hi>few</hi> of theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were
<hi>baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> only thanks God, that he <hi>himſelf</hi> had
not done it, except to a <hi>few,</hi> for the Reaſons before given: But
<hi>Acts</hi> xviii. 8. it is ſaid, That beſides <hi>Criſpus,</hi> whom
<hi>Paul</hi> himſelf <hi>baptized,</hi> MANY <hi>of the</hi> Corinthians
<hi>were baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, they were all <hi>baptized,</hi> as many as <hi>believed,</hi>
as before is prov'd. And, in this very place, St. <hi>Paul</hi> taking it for
grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that all who <hi>believed,</hi> were <hi>baptiz'd,</hi> which I have
already obſerv'd from his Queſtion to <hi>certain Diſciples,</hi> Acts
xix. 3. not whether they were <hi>baptized,</hi> but <hi>unto what,</hi> i. e.
<hi>In what Name,</hi> they had been <hi>baptized?</hi> So here 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
i. 13. He does not make the Queſtion, whether they had been
<hi>baptized?</hi> That he takes for granted. But <hi>in what Name, were ye
baptized?</hi> Which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, not only that <hi>all</hi> were
<hi>baptized,</hi> but likewiſe that all who were <hi>baptized,</hi> were
baptized in ſome <hi>outward Name;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it was the
<hi>Outward,</hi> i. e. <hi>Water-Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:95759:20"/>VII. But the ſecond Text objected,
<hi>V.</hi> 17. is yet to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for; where St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays,
<hi>Christ ſent me not to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, but to Preach the Goſpel.</hi> This he
ſaid in juſtification of himſelf for having <hi>baptiz'd</hi> ſo
<hi>few</hi> in that place; for which he bleſſes God, becauſe, as it
happened, it prov'd a great juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his not baptizing in <hi>his
own Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, on the other hand, here wou'd ſeem to be a Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in
him of his Duty: For if it was his Duty to have bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd them <hi>all,</hi>
and he baptiz'd but a <hi>few,</hi> here was a great Neglect.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this, we find, that there was no Neglect in not
<hi>baptizing</hi> them, for that, not a <hi>few</hi> but <hi>many</hi> of the
<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> were <hi>baptized, Acts</hi> xviii. 8. that is, as many
as <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,</hi> as before is ſhewn.</p>
            <p>But then who was it that <hi>baptized</hi> thoſe <hi>many?</hi>
For St. <hi>Paul baptized</hi> but a <hi>few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Anſwer.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> employ'd others, under
him, to <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he vindicates this, by ſaying, That he was <hi>not ſent to
Baptize,</hi> i. e. <hi>principally</hi> and <hi>chiefly;</hi> that was not the
<hi>chief</hi> part of his Commiſſion: But the <hi>greater</hi> and more
<hi>difficult</hi> part was that of <hi>Preaching,</hi> to <hi>Diſpute</hi>
with, <hi>Perſwade</hi> and <hi>Convert</hi> the <hi>Heathen</hi> World. To
this, <hi>great Parts,</hi> and <hi>Courage,</hi> and <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
Gifts</hi> were neceſſary: But to Adminiſter the <hi>outward Form</hi> of
<hi>Baptiſm</hi> to thoſe who were <hi>Converted,</hi> had no Difficulty in
it; requir'd no great <hi>Parts,</hi> or <hi>Endowments,</hi> only a <hi>lawful
Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to Execute it.</p>
            <p>And it wou'd have taken up too much of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> time,
it was impoſſible for them to have <hi>baptized,</hi> with their own Hands,
thoſe vaſt Multitudes whom they Converted. <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> had
reach'd to all Quarters of the then known World, as far almoſt, as at this
Day, before the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> left the World. And cou'd Twelve Men
<hi>Baptize</hi> the <hi>whole World?</hi> Their <hi>Progreſs</hi> was not
the leaſt of their <hi>Miracles:</hi> The <hi>Bread of Life</hi> multiply'd
faſter, in their <hi>Diſtribution</hi> of it, than the <hi>Loaves</hi> by
our SAVIOUR<hi>'s Breaking</hi> of them. St. <hi>Peter</hi> Converted about
<hi>three Thouſand</hi> at one Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 41. And at another
time about <hi>five Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,</hi> Ch. iv. 4. <hi>Multitudes both of Men and
Women.</hi> Ch. v. 14. Many more than the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> cou'd have
<hi>counted;</hi> much more<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95759:20"/>than they cou'd have
<hi>baptized;</hi> for which if they had ſtay'd, they had made ſlender
Progreſs. No. The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were ſent, as <hi>loud Heraulds,</hi>
to <hi>proclaim</hi> to all the Earth, to run ſwiftly, and gather much
People; and not to ſtay (they cou'd not ſtay) for the <hi>baptizing</hi>
with their own Hands, all that they Converted: They left that to others, whom
they had ordain'd to Adminiſter it. Yet not ſo, as to exclude themſelves;
but they themſelves did <hi>Baptize,</hi> where they ſaw occaſion, as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> here did BAPTIZE <hi>Criſpus</hi> and <hi>Gaius,</hi> and the
Houſe of <hi>Stephanas,</hi> ſome of the Principal of the
<hi>Corinthians.</hi> Not that he was oblig'd to have done it himſelf, having
others to whom he might have left it: For he was not <hi>ſent,</hi> that is,
put under the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> to <hi>Baptize</hi> with his own Hands,
but to <hi>Preach,</hi> to Convert others, that was his <hi>principal</hi>
Province, and which he was not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, upon the account of
<hi>baptizing,</hi> which others could do as well as he.</p>
            <p>But if you will ſo underſtand the Words of his not being
<hi>ſent,</hi> i. e. that it was not within his <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> that
he was not <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd</hi> by <hi>Christ,</hi> to <hi>Baptize,</hi> then it
wou'd have been a <hi>Sin,</hi> and great <hi>Preſumption</hi> in him, to
have <hi>baptized</hi> any body.</p>
            <p>Nay more. This Text, thus underſtood, is flatly contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to
<hi>Matt.</hi> xxviii. 19. which ſays, <hi>Go, Baptize:</hi> And this ſays,
<hi>I am not ſent to Baptize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are contradictory, if by, <hi>I am not ſent,</hi> be
underſtood, I have not <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to
<hi>Baptize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by, <hi>I am not ſent,</hi> no more is meant in this
<hi>Text,</hi> than that <hi>Baptizing</hi> is not the <hi>chief</hi> or
<hi>principal</hi> part of my <hi>Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> As if a
<hi>General</hi> were accuſed for <hi>Muſtering</hi> and <hi>Liſting</hi>
Men <hi>in his own Name,</hi> and not in the <hi>King</hi>'s, and he ſhou'd
ſay, in Vindication of himſelf, that he had never <hi>liſted</hi> any,
except ſuch and ſuch <hi>Officers;</hi> for that he was not <hi>ſent</hi>
to <hi>Muſter,</hi> or <hi>Drill</hi> Men, or to Exerciſe <hi>Troops</hi>
or <hi>Regiments,</hi> but to Command the <hi>Army:</hi> Wou'd it follow from
hence, that he had not Power to <hi>Exerciſe</hi> a <hi>Troop</hi> or a
<hi>Regiment,</hi> or that it was not within his <hi>Commiſſion?</hi> Or if
a <hi>Doctor</hi> of <hi>Phyſick</hi> ſhould ſay, That it was not his
Part to <hi>compound Medicines,</hi> and make up <hi>Drugs</hi> (that was the
<hi>Apothecary</hi>'s Buſineſs) but to give <hi>Preſcriptions;</hi> wou'd
any Man infer from this, that he might not <hi>Compound</hi> his own

            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:95759:21"/>Or if (to come nearer) a <hi>Profeſſor</hi>
of <hi>Divinity,</hi> or a <hi>Biſhop</hi>' ſhou'd ſay, That he was not
<hi>ſent</hi> to <hi>Teach School;</hi> this wou'd not imply that he might
not <hi>Keep School;</hi> nay, he ought, if there were no others to do it: So
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was not <hi>ſent</hi> to
ſpend his Time in <hi>Baptizing, Viſiting the Sick,</hi> or other Parts of
his Duty, (which others might perform) ſo as to hinder his great Work in
Converting of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> All of whom he cou'd not <hi>Baptize,</hi>
nor <hi>Viſit</hi> all their <hi>Sick:</hi> Yet both theſe were within his
<hi>Commiſſion,</hi> and he <hi>might</hi> and <hi>did</hi> Execute them
where he ſaw occaſion. As if all the <hi>Sick</hi> in <hi>London</hi>
ſhou'd expect to be <hi>Viſited</hi> by the Biſhop of <hi>London;</hi>
and all the <hi>Children</hi> ſhou'd be brought to be <hi>baptized</hi> by
him; he might well ſay, That he was not <hi>ſent</hi> to <hi>Baptize,</hi>
or to <hi>Viſit</hi> their <hi>Sick,</hi> but to look after his
<hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Function: And ſend them for theſe <hi>Offices,</hi> to
others, under him: And yet this wou'd no ways imply, that theſe Offices were
not within the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Commiſſion; or that he was not
<hi>ſent</hi> both to <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize,</hi> and to <hi>Viſit the Sick:</hi>
But only that he was not ſent <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally</hi> and <hi>chiefly</hi> to
<hi>Baptize,</hi> or to <hi>Viſit the Sick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to that Phraſe of being <hi>ſent;</hi> we find it us'd in
this ſame ſenſe, to mean only being <hi>chiefly</hi> and
<hi>principally</hi> ſent. Thus, <hi>Gen.</hi> xlv. 8. <hi>Joſeph</hi>
ſaid to his Brethren, <hi>It was not you that ſent me hither, but God.</hi>
It was certainly his <hi>Brethren</hi> who <hi>ſent</hi> him, for they
<hi>ſold</hi> him into <hi>Egypt:</hi> But it was not They,
<hi>principally</hi> and <hi>chiefly,</hi> but <hi>God,</hi> who had other and
extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Ends in it.</p>
            <p>Adam <hi>was not deceived</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle, 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 14.) <hi>but the Woman being deceived, was in the
Tranſgreſſion. Adam</hi> was <hi>deceived,</hi> and <hi>fell</hi> as well
as the <hi>Woman;</hi> but the meaning is, he was not <hi>firſt,</hi> or
<hi>principally</hi> deceived.</p>
            <p>Again. As for you who ſtick ſo cloſe to the <hi>Letter</hi>
(when it ſeemeth to ſerve your turn) <hi>Go ye and learn what that
meaneth,</hi> I WILL HAVE MERCY, AND NOT SACRIFICE, <hi>Matt.</hi> ix. 13.</p>
            <p>By which it cannot be underſtood, that God did not require
<hi>Sacrifice;</hi> for he <hi>commanded</hi> it upon Pain of <hi>Death.</hi>
Yet he ſays, (Jer. vii. 22.) <hi>I ſpake not unto your Fathers, nor
commanded them—concerning Burnt-Offerings, or Sacrifices: But this thing
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded I them, ſaying, Obey my Voice,</hi> &amp;c. according as it is
written, (1 Sam xv. 22.) <hi>To Obey is better than Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:95759:21"/>By all which cannot be meant, that God did not
Command the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning <hi>Burnt-Offerings</hi> and
<hi>Sacrifices</hi> (for we know how particularly they were commanded) but that
the <hi>outward Sacrifice</hi> was not the <hi>chief</hi> and
<hi>principal</hi> part of the Command; which reſpected <hi>chiefly</hi> the
<hi>inward</hi> Sacrifice and Circumciſion of the <hi>Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which when they neglected, and lean'd wholly to the
<hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> then God deteſts their <hi>Oblations;</hi> Iſa. i. 14.
<hi>Your new Moons, and your appointed Feaſts my Soul hateth, I am weary to
bear them.</hi> And he ſays, V. 12. <hi>Who hath required this at your
Hand?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was certainly <hi>God</hi> who had <hi>required</hi> all theſe
things at their hands; but theſe <hi>outward Performances,</hi> (tho' the
<hi>Neglect</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe</hi> of them was puniſhed with
<hi>Death</hi>) yet they were not the <hi>chief</hi> and <hi>principal</hi>
part of the Command, being intended <hi>chiefly</hi> for the ſake of the
<hi>Inward</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> Part: From which when they were
ſeparated, they were (like the <hi>Body,</hi> when the <hi>Soul</hi> is gone)
a <hi>dead</hi> and a <hi>loathſome</hi> CARCASS of <hi>Religion:</hi> And
which <hi>God</hi> is therefore ſaid, not to have commanded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he
did not Command them without the other: As he made not the <hi>Body</hi>
without the <hi>Soul;</hi> yet he made the <hi>Body</hi> as well as the
<hi>Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. And as there is <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> in
<hi>Man,</hi> ſo (while <hi>Man</hi> is in the <hi>Body</hi>) there muſt be
a <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> that is, an
<hi>outward</hi> and an <hi>inward</hi> WORSHIP, with our <hi>Bodies</hi> as
well as our <hi>Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the Separation of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> in
<hi>Man,</hi> is called <hi>Death;</hi> ſo is the Separation of the
<hi>outward</hi> and the <hi>inward</hi> Part of <hi>Religion,</hi> the
<hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>outward</hi> is the <hi>Cask,</hi> and the <hi>inward</hi>
is the <hi>Wine.</hi> The <hi>Cask</hi> is no Part of the <hi>Wine;</hi> but if

loſe the <hi>inward</hi> Parts of it too.</p>
            <p>As is ſadly experienc'd in the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who, having
thrown off the <hi>outward Baptiſm,</hi> and the other <hi>Sacrament</hi> of
<hi>Christ's Death,</hi> have, thereby, loft the <hi>inward</hi> thing
ſignify'd, which is, the PERSONAL <hi>Christ,</hi> as Exiſting <hi>without
all other Men,</hi> and having ſo <hi>Suffer'd, Roſe, Aſcended,</hi> and
now, and for ever,<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95759:22"/>
               <hi>Sitteth</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> in
his true proper <hi>Human Nature,</hi> WITHOUT <hi>all other Men.</hi> This the
<hi>Quakers</hi> will not own, (except ſome of the <hi>New</hi> Separation)
and this they have loſt, by their Neglect of thoſe <hi>outward
Sacraments,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> appointed for this very End (among
others) that is, as <hi>Remembrances</hi> of his <hi>Death:</hi> For it had
been morally impoſſible for Men, who had <hi>conſtantly</hi> and with
<hi>due Reverence,</hi> attended theſe holy <hi>Sacraments</hi> of
<hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> ever to have <hi>forgot</hi>

theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> have done.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Enemy</hi> has perſwaded them to break the

the <hi>Wine</hi> is ſpilt, and the <hi>Soul</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> is

the whole <hi>inward,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> which is a
true <hi>Faith</hi> in the OUTWARD <hi>Christ,</hi> and in the
<hi>Satisfaction</hi> made for our <hi>Sins,</hi> by his <hi>Blood</hi>
OUTWARDLY <hi>ſhed;</hi> and in his <hi>Interceſſion,</hi> in our
<hi>Nature,</hi> as our <hi>High-Priest,</hi> at his <hi>Father's</hi> Right
Hand, <hi>now,</hi> in <hi>Heaven;</hi> into which <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> He
has carry'd his own <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Expiation, once</hi> offer'd upon the
<hi>Croſs,</hi> and <hi>preſents</hi> it, for <hi>ever,</hi> as the
<hi>Atonement</hi> and full <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for the <hi>Sins</hi> of
the <hi>whole World;</hi> but apply'd only by true <hi>Faith</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>This is the only true <hi>Chriſtian Faith:</hi> And from this the

OUTWARD <hi>Means of Grace,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> has commanded, and given
us as the only OUTWARD GROUNDS for our <hi>Hope of Glory.</hi> For how can that

appointed; who came down from <hi>Heaven,</hi> on purpoſe to <hi>ſhew</hi>
and <hi>lead</hi> us the way thither; yet we will be <hi>wiſer</hi> than he,
find fault with his <hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> as being too much upon the

            <p n="9">
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:95759:22"/>IX. But to return, if the <hi>Quakers</hi>
cou'd find ſuch <hi>Texts</hi> concerning <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as I have
ſhewn above concerning <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> as if it were ſaid, That
<hi>God</hi> did <hi>not command</hi> Baptiſm; that he <hi>hated it,</hi> and
was <hi>weary to bear it,</hi> that <hi>he would not have it,</hi> &amp;c. If
ſuch <hi>Texts</hi> cou'd be found, How wou'd the <hi>Quakers</hi> triumph!
Who wou'd be able to ſtand before them! And yet, if ſuch were found, they
wou'd prove no more againſt the <hi>outward</hi> BAPTISM, than they did
againſt the <hi>outward</hi> SACRIFICES, <hi>i. e.</hi> That if any regarded
nothing elſe in <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> than the <hi>outward Waſhing,</hi> it
wou'd be as hateful to God, as the <hi>Jewiſh Sacrifices,</hi> when they
regarded nothing more in them but the <hi>Outward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it may be truly ſaid, That God did not Command either ſuch
<hi>Sacrifices,</hi> or ſuch a <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> becauſe he commanded not
the <hi>outward</hi> alone, but with reſpect unto, and <hi>chiefly</hi> for
the ſake of the <hi>Inward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, therefore, as all theſe, and other the like Expreſſions
in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> did not at all tend to the <hi>Abolition,</hi>
only to the <hi>Rectification</hi> of the Legal <hi>Sacrifices:</hi> So, much
leſs, can that ſingle Expreſſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 17. of
<hi>Paul</hi>'s ſaying (upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and in the ſenſe above
mention'd) that <hi>he was not ſent to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, but to Preach,</hi> much

as the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> were by the <hi>Levitical Prieſts.</hi>

            <p n="1">1ſt. To ſee how <hi>Sacrifices</hi> are actually us'd
<hi>now</hi> in thoſe Parts of the World where they do <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
And being convinc'd that theſe do uſe <hi>outward Sacrifices,</hi> and
underſtand the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> in that ſenſe, to
inquire</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Whether they did not receive this from their
<hi>Fathers,</hi> ſo upward, to the firſt Inſtitution? And is not this
the ſureſt Rule to find out the meaning of the <hi>first Command? viz.</hi>
How it was <hi>underſtood</hi> and <hi>practis'd</hi> by thoſe to whom the
Command was <hi>first</hi> given; and from them, through all Ages ſince. Upon
all which <hi>Topicks,</hi> the preſent <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> now us'd,
may be as much demonſtrated to be the ſame which was <hi>practis'd</hi> by
the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and conſequently, which was <hi>commanded</hi> by
<hi>Christ,</hi> as the <hi>outward Sacrifices</hi> can be ſhewn to have
been, at firſt, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
<hi>practis'd</hi> by them.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. And as for that precarious Plea, before confuted, of the
<hi>Baptiſm</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> practis'd, being only a
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with the <hi>Jews;</hi> there is more <hi>Pretence</hi> to ſay,
that the <hi>Jewiſh Sacrifices</hi> were in Complyance with the <hi>Heathen

            </p>
            <p>I ſay, there is more <hi>Pretence</hi> for this, but not more
<hi>Truth.</hi> More <hi>pretence,</hi> becauſe it has been advanced of late,
by Men of greater Figure than <hi>Quakers,</hi> That the <hi>Levitical
Sacrifices</hi> were commanded by God, in Complyance with the <hi>Gentile
Sacrifices,</hi> which were before uſed.</p>
            <p>But this is a Subject by it ſelf. I now only ſhew the
<hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> that there is more ground to <hi>ſpiritualize</hi> away
<hi>Sacrifices</hi> from the <hi>Letter,</hi> than <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> more
<hi>pretence</hi> for it from <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and from
ſome <hi>odd Opinions</hi> of ſome Learned Men.</p>
            <p>And if the Denial of OUTWARD <hi>Sacrifices</hi> wou'd be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
(as the like of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> was, when <hi>first</hi> ſtarted) to be

<hi>Inſtitutions</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> were regarded, they were
<hi>hateful</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and he <hi>rejected</hi> them; tho', at the

            <p n="1">I. THE Words of the Text are theſe. <hi>One Lord, one Faith,
one Baptiſm;</hi> whence the <hi>Quakers</hi> argue thus. That
<hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> is one <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Baptiſm</hi>
with the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> is another <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> becauſe the
<hi>one</hi> is the <hi>Outward,</hi> and the other the <hi>Inward</hi>
Baptiſm; and <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>inward</hi> are <hi>two</hi> Things:
Therefore that theſe muſt be <hi>two</hi> Baptiſms: which, they ſay, is
contrary to this <hi>Text,</hi> that ſays, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have but
ONE <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as they have but ONE <hi>Lord,</hi> and ONE
<hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. I Anſwer. <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Inward</hi> are
<hi>Two</hi> things; but yet they hinder not the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of
<hi>that</hi> which is compos'd of <hi>Both.</hi> Thus <hi>Soul</hi> and
<hi>Body</hi> are <hi>Two</hi> things, and of <hi>Natures</hi> the moſt
different of any Two things in the World; yet they hinder not the
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Man,</hi> who is compos'd of <hi>Both.</hi> Nay, it
is the <hi>Compoſition</hi> of theſe <hi>Two</hi> that makes up the
<hi>One</hi> MAN; inſomuch, that when theſe <hi>Two</hi> are
<hi>Divided,</hi> the MAN is no more; for it is nothing elſe which we call
<hi>Death,</hi> but the <hi>Separation</hi> of <hi>Soul</hi> and
<hi>Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And (as before ſhewn, <hi>Sect.</hi> VII. <hi>Num.</hi> VIII.)
while there is <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> in <hi>Man,</hi> there muſt be
a <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> that is, an
<hi>Outward</hi> and an <hi>Inward</hi> Part of <hi>Religion:</hi> And if we
deſtroy the <hi>Outward,</hi> we ſhall loſe the <hi>Inward;</hi>
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Outward</hi> was deſign'd for the Safety and
Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Inward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, that the <hi>Inward</hi> is the <hi>Chief</hi> and
<hi>Principal</hi> Part, as of <hi>Man,</hi> ſo of his <hi>Religion:</hi> But
this does not infer, that the <hi>Outward</hi> is not likewiſe neceſſary.
We are commanded, <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 1. to <hi>Preſent our</hi> Bodies <hi>a
living Sacrifice,</hi> and this is call'd our <hi>Reaſonable Service.</hi>
For, is it not Reaſonable, that, ſince our <hi>Bodies</hi> are
<hi>God</hi>'s Creatures, as well as our <hi>Souls,</hi> He ſhould have the
<hi>Adoration</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of our <hi>Bodies,</hi> as well as of
our <hi>Souls?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:95759:25"/>There is no <hi>Outward</hi> or <hi>Publick</hi>
WORSHIP but by our <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi> we cannot <hi>otherwiſe</hi> expreſs
the INWARD <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Adoration</hi> of our <hi>Minds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is ſo <hi>Natural,</hi> that whoever has a due
<hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Awe</hi> of the <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> cannot
help to Expreſs it <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,</hi> by the <hi>Adoration</hi> of his
<hi>Body,</hi> in his Approaches to <hi>God,</hi> even tho' in
<hi>Private.</hi> As our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour,</hi> in His <hi>Agony,</hi>
fell <hi>proſtrate</hi> upon <hi>His Face</hi> to the Earth.</p>
            <p>And whoever deny the <hi>Outward Worſhip</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> or
perform it <hi>ſlovenly,</hi> and <hi>careleſly,</hi> it is a full
Demonſtration that they have no <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Real Devotion,</hi> or
<hi>Juſt Apprehenſion</hi> of the <hi>Almighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the <hi>Outward</hi> Part of <hi>Religion</hi> muſt, by
no means, be let go, becauſe the <hi>Inward</hi> certainly dies, when the
<hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> is gone.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Outward</hi> and the <hi>Inward</hi> WORSHIP of
<hi>God</hi> are not <hi>Two</hi> Worſhips, but only Two <hi>Parts</hi> of
the <hi>ſame</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. As <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> are not
<hi>Two Men,</hi> but <hi>Two Parts</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> Man; ſo the
Adoration of this <hi>One</hi> Man, <hi>Outwardly</hi> in his <hi>Body,</hi>
and <hi>Inwardly</hi> in his <hi>Soul,</hi> is not TWO <hi>Worſhips,</hi> but
TWO <hi>Parts</hi> of the SAME <hi>Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. There is but <hi>one Faith,</hi> yet this <hi>Faith</hi>
conſiſts of <hi>ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts.</hi> There is a <hi>Faith</hi> in
<hi>God,</hi> of which the <hi>Heathens</hi> do partake: There is a
<hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which denominates Men
<hi>Chriſtians:</hi> Yet theſe are not <hi>Two Faiths</hi> in a
<hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but TWO <hi>Parts</hi> of the SAME <hi>Faith.</hi> There
is likewiſe a <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Promiſes</hi> of the

<hi>God:</hi> And there are Degrees of this <hi>Faith,</hi> of which one
Chriſtian does partake more than another. And yet to <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
there is but <hi>One Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Belief of a <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are TWO
<hi>Faiths</hi> or <hi>Beliefs,</hi> becauſe many do Believe a <hi>God,</hi>
who do not Believe in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Yet, in a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> they
are not TWO <hi>Faiths,</hi> but ONE <hi>Faith;</hi> becauſe the
<hi>one,</hi> that is, the <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> does
ſuppoſe the <hi>other,</hi> that is, the <hi>Belief</hi> of a <hi>God;</hi>
it only <hi>Adds</hi> to it, and <hi>Builds</hi> upon it. And this makes them
no more TWO <hi>Faiths,</hi> than building an Houſe a <hi>Story</hi> higher
makes it TWO <hi>Houſes.</hi>

            <p n="4">
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:95759:25"/>IV. There is but <hi>One Lord,</hi> that
is <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yet He conſiſts of an <hi>Outward</hi> and an
<hi>Inward</hi> Part, of <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul.</hi> Nay more, of both the
<hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Human Natures.</hi> I might urge the different
<hi>Perſons</hi> in the <hi>One Divine Nature;</hi> but this will be no
Argument to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who Deny it. But they Deny not (ſeemingly
at leaſt) the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and therefore, as this
<hi>Lord</hi> is but <hi>One,</hi> tho' conſiſting of ſeveral
<hi>Natures;</hi> and His <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> but
<hi>One,</hi> tho' conſiſting of ſeveral <hi>Parts;</hi> why may not His

<hi>Outward</hi> and an <hi>Inward</hi> Part?</p>
            <p n="5">V. There was an <hi>Outward</hi> and an <hi>Inward</hi>
CIRCUMCISION, as well as an <hi>Outward</hi> and <hi>Inward</hi> BAPTISM; yet
no Man will ſay, that there were TWO <hi>Circumciſions</hi> under the

<hi>Sect.</hi> VII. <hi>Num.</hi> X, &amp; XI, of the ſtronger Preſumptions
to deny the <hi>Outward</hi> SACRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FICES under the <hi>Law,</hi> than the
<hi>Outward</hi> BAPTISM under the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. Let me add, that <hi>Circumciſion</hi> was
diſcontinu'd 40 Years in the Wilderneſs (<hi>Joſh.</hi> v. 5.) yet this
was made no Argument againſt the <hi>Reviving</hi> and <hi>Continuance</hi>

            <p>But <hi>Baptiſm</hi> has not been diſcontinu'd <hi>one

Therefore Leaving the Principles of the Doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto

<hi>the Principles,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Baptiſm</hi> being nam'd in the
ſecond Verſe, he infers, That the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here Commands to
<hi>leave off</hi> the Practice of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which, he ſays, had
been Indulg'd to the firſt <hi>Converts</hi> to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi>

But now as to this Inference from <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 1. <hi>John Gratton</hi>
ſays, <hi>P.</hi> 47. That this word LEAVING <hi>ſeems to entail the
foregoing words in the Chapter before, where he</hi> (the Apoſtle) <hi>had
been telling them of their Childiſhneſs</hi> (<hi>he mentions the Doctrine
of Baptiſm, which cannot prove the Impoſing of</hi> Water-Baptiſm,
<hi>any more than all the rest</hi>) <hi>and was now for bringing them on to a
further State, where they might know Perfection—And it ſeems clear to
me, that there was ſome need for thoſe things, they had ſo long lain like
Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren weak, and Babes in, to be left.</hi> Therefore leaving theſe, let
us go on to Perfection; <hi>and ſaith further;</hi> This will we do, if God

the World's End, then why ſhou'd</hi> Paul <hi>have been ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest at
that Day, which was ſoon after Chriſt's Aſcenſion, to have had them
then to leave them?</hi> Theſe are his words, and a great deal more to the

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:95759:26"/>II. But it is very wonderful, how any Man
cou'd ſhut his Eyes ſo hard, as to overſee not only the whole

Blindneſs be other than wilful? The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was reproving ſome
of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> for their ſlender Proficiency in the Knowledge of the
<hi>Goſpel.</hi> And that he cou'd not lead them to the <hi>Higher
Myſteries,</hi> they hardly yet being well fixed in the very
<hi>Rudiments</hi> and <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> As if
one ſhou'd ſay, That he would make an ill <hi>Doctor</hi> of
<hi>Divinity,</hi> who had not yet learned his <hi>Catechiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the former Chapter having treated of
the Myſterious Parallel 'twixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi>
he ſtops ſhort, Ver. 11, upon the account of their Incapacity, <hi>of
whom</hi> (that is, of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Melchiſedec</hi>) <hi>we
have many things to ſay, and hard to be uttered, ſeeing ye are dull of
hearing: For when for the time ye ought to be Teachers, ye have need that one
teach you again, which be the firſt Principles of the Oracles of God.</hi>
Then he goes on to provoke them to a further <hi>Proficiency</hi> in the words
of the Text we are now conſidering, <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſays he)
<hi>leaving the Principles of the Doctrin of Chriſt, let us go on unto
Perfection, not laying again the Foundation of Repentance from dead Works, and
of Faith towards God, of the Doctrin of Baptiſms, and of laying on of Hands

we do, if God permit.</hi>

            <p>Here is the Doctrine of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> placed in the very Heart

            <p>Now they ſay, That all the <hi>Heathen,</hi> every Man that is

and, that this <hi>Light within</hi> is ſufficient for his

Faith towards God,</hi> which is the Second of the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
mention'd in this <hi>Text.</hi> The Third is <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which they

<hi>Church,</hi> which are all perform'd by <hi>laying on of Hands.</hi> And
how much ſoever the <hi>Quakers</hi> and others do deſpiſe them, yet the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> here reckons them among the <hi>Fundamentals:</hi> For the
<hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> are
<hi>Eſſential</hi> to it, as it is a <hi>Society,</hi> it could not
otherwiſe be a <hi>Society.</hi> The Sin of <hi>Korah</hi> was nothing but
concerning <hi>Church-Government.</hi> And <hi>Aaron</hi>'s <hi>Rod</hi> that
Budded,<note place="margin">Num. 16, &amp; 17 <hi>Ch.</hi>
               </note> in confirmation

writing againſt ſome <hi>Diſſenters</hi> amongſt the

very high, and <hi>the Power of the Elders in the Church,</hi> p. 13. and
preſſes that Text, <hi>Matth.</hi> xviii. 17. <hi>Tell it unto the

<hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. That Chriſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>as well gave His Church
Power to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as to Try Spirits, is not hard to prove. That notable
Paſſage,</hi> Go, tell the Church, <hi>does it to our hand: For if in
caſe of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Offence betwixt Brethren, the Church is made Abſolute
Judge, from whom there is no Appeal in this World; how much more in any the
least caſe that concerns the</hi> NATURE, BEING, FAITH, <hi>and</hi> WORSHIP
<hi>of the Church her ſelf?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Caſe was quite alter'd when he came to Anſwer that
ſame <hi>Text,</hi> as urged againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> by the
<hi>Church;</hi> which he does in his <hi>Addreſs to Proteſtants,</hi> p.
152, 153, &amp; 154. of the <hi>Second Edition</hi> in <hi>Octavo,</hi> printed
1692. And then that Text does not relate at all to <hi>Faith</hi> or
<hi>Worſhip,</hi> but only to <hi>private Injuries.</hi> For having deny'd
the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in Matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> he
puts the Objection thus againſt himſelf: <hi>But what then can be the
meaning of Christ's Words,</hi> Go, tell the Church? <hi>Very well. I
Anſwer</hi> (ſays he, <hi>p.</hi> 153.) <hi>'Tis not about</hi> Faith,
<hi>but</hi> Injury, <hi>that Christ ſpeaks; and the place explains itſelf,
which is this;</hi> Moreover, if thy Brother ſhall TRESPASS againſt THEE,
go and tell him his FAULT, between thee and him alone. <hi>Here is</hi> Wrong,
<hi>not</hi> Religion; Injuſtice, <hi>not</hi> Faith <hi>or</hi> Conſcience
<hi>concern'd; as ſome would have it, to maintain their
Church-Power.—The words</hi> TRESPASS <hi>and</hi> FAULT <hi>prove
abundantly, that He only meant</hi> Private <hi>and</hi> Perſonal Injuries;
<hi>and that not only from the common and undeniable ſignification and uſe
of the words</hi> TRESPASS <hi>and</hi> FAULT, <hi>but from the way Christ
directs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands for Accommodation,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Perſon
wronged ſpeak <pb n="43" facs="tcp:95759:28"/>to him that commits the Injury, alone; if
that will not do, that he take one or two with him: But no man can think, that
if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to</hi> FAITH <hi>or</hi> WORSHIP, <hi>I ought to Receive the
Judgment of one, or two, or three, for a ſufficient Rule.—Therefore it
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not relate to Matters of</hi> FAITH, <hi>and Scruples of</hi> CONSCIENCE,
<hi>but</hi> PERSONAL <hi>and</hi> PRIVATE INJURIES.</p>
            <p>Thus he. But tho' the Judgment of <hi>one, two,</hi> or
<hi>three,</hi> is not of itſelf a <hi>ſufficient Rule,</hi> (none ever
ſaid it was) yet may not <hi>one, two,</hi> or <hi>three</hi> ADMONISH one
another, even in Matters of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as well as
of <hi>Private Injuries,</hi> and, in caſe of <hi>Refractorineſs</hi> and
<hi>Obſtinacy,</hi> bring the Cauſe before the <hi>Church? Thou ſhalt in
any wiſe Rebuke thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and not ſuffer Sin upon him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. xix. 17.</note> Yet was not the <hi>Judgment</hi> of every
Man a <hi>ſufficient Rule</hi> to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. And our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s
commanding to bring the Cauſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally before the <hi>Church,</hi> ſhews
plainly, that the Judgment of the <hi>one, two,</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> was not
meant for a <hi>ſufficient Rule,</hi> that is, the <hi>ultimate</hi>
Deciſion.</p>
            <p>But in Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Penn</hi>'s Argument, That this Text,
<hi>Tell it unto the Church,</hi> was meant only of <hi>Private Injuries,</hi>
I ſhall repeat but his own words before quoted, and grant, that as it was
meant of <hi>Private Injuries,</hi> ſo, as Mr. <hi>Penn</hi> very well
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, <hi>How much more in any the leaſt Caſe that concerns the</hi>

above quoted, of continuing the Practice of <hi>the Lord's Supper,</hi> till
his <hi>Coming?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they ſay, That this was only to have it continu'd to thoſe

in their Hearts.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Who can ſay, That Chriſt is <hi>thoroughly</hi> formed
in his Heart? May there not be greater and greater <hi>Degrees</hi> of the

be a <hi>Coming,</hi> or <hi>Preſence</hi> of his in the <hi>Heart:</hi> And
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by this Rule, Chriſt is <hi>Come</hi> to every Man, in ſome
<hi>Degree</hi> or other: And, if there be not ſome <hi>ſtinting,</hi> or
<hi>aſcertaining</hi> of this <hi>Degree,</hi> then <hi>Christ</hi> was
<hi>always</hi> ſo <hi>Come</hi> to <hi>All,</hi> as to make the
<hi>Inſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> uſeleſs, at <hi>all
Times,</hi> to <hi>All.</hi> Nay, it was <hi>ended,</hi> before it
<hi>began.</hi> For, if his <hi>Inward Coming</hi> does <hi>end</hi> it, it
cou'd never <hi>begin,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>always</hi> ſo <hi>Inwardly
Come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if there are ſome <hi>Degrees</hi> of his <hi>Coming</hi> ſo
<hi>weak</hi> as to need the Help of the <hi>Outward Inſtitution,</hi> to
which God has annexed the Promiſe of his <hi>Grace,</hi> when duly
<hi>Adminiſtred,</hi> and <hi>Receiv'd,</hi> then theſe <hi>Degrees</hi>
muſt be known, elſe thoſe may be depriv'd<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95759:31"/>of the
Benefit of it, who have moſt need of it: And thoſe are they who think that
they need it leaſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Quakers</hi> do not always pretend, all of them,
to the ſame <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Perfection</hi> (if there be
<hi>Degrees</hi> in <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>) they muſt be ſenſible
ſometimes (at leaſt others are) of the many Weakneſſes of ſome of
their Number: Why then do they not allow the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> to thoſe
<hi>Weaker</hi> ones? Elſe they muſt ſay, That it was not intended for
the <hi>Weak</hi> more than for the <hi>Strong.</hi> And ſo, that the
<hi>Inſtitution</hi> and <hi>Practiſe</hi> of it, by <hi>Christ</hi> and
his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> was wholly <hi>uſeleſs,</hi> and to <hi>no
purpoſe.</hi> And that all thoſe high Things ſaid of it, That it is the
<hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi>
1 Cor. x. 16. And <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own Words, <hi>This is my Body:</hi> And
therefore, that the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it unworthily, is being <hi>Guilty of the Body
and Blood of the Lord:</hi> That therefore we ſhou'd approach to it, with the
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Preparation,</hi> to <hi>Examine our
ſelves</hi> ſeriouſly and diligently, that we may receive it with pure
Hearts and Minds: And the Dreadful Judgments which do attend the
<hi>Neglect,</hi> or <hi>Abuſe</hi> of it, not only <hi>ſundry
Diſcaſes,</hi> and divers kinds of <hi>Deaths,</hi> but <hi>Damnation,</hi>
1 Cor. xi. from Ver. 27. I ſay all theſe were Words thrown into the Air, of
no Meaning, nor Import at all, if the <hi>Quaker</hi> Interpretation be true,
which makes nothing at all of <hi>the Lord's Supper,</hi> but renders it wholly
<hi>Precarious</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant,</hi> even at the time of its
<hi>Inſtitution;</hi> and now to be <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>pernicious,</hi>
as drawing Men from the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> to meer <hi>Shadows;</hi> for
they make of it <hi>no more!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. But I wou'd beſeech them to conſider how much more
highly God does value it; and how Material a part of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he does make
it: For when St. <hi>Paul</hi> was taught the Faith immediately from Heaven,
and not from thoſe who were <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> before him (as he tells us,
<hi>Gal.</hi> i. 16, 17.) <hi>Christ</hi> took care to inſtruct him as to
this of <hi>the Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper</hi> particularly. And he preſſes it
upon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as having received it from God. <hi>For I have
received of the Lord</hi> (ſays he, 1 Cor. xi. 23.) <hi>that which alſo I
delivered unto you, that the Lord Jeſus, the ſame Night in which he was
Betrayed, took Bread,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo goes on to relate the whole
<hi>Inſtitution</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper,</hi> and the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Conſequences, the Benefits and Advantages of it; the <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> 
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:95759:32"/>preparatory to it; and the <hi>Vengeance</hi> both
<hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Eternal,</hi> which was due to the <hi>Contempt</hi>
of it.</p>
            <p>This ſhews, that <hi>Christ</hi> did not Inſtitute this <hi>Holy
Sacrament</hi> by Chance. It was the laſt Act of his Life; and his <hi>Dying
Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi> to his <hi>Church;</hi> fill'd with all his
<hi>Bleſſings,</hi> and carrying with it, to the <hi>Worthy Receivers,</hi>
the whole <hi>Merits,</hi> and <hi>Purchaſe</hi> of his <hi>Death</hi> and
<hi>Paſſion,</hi> the <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of our <hi>Sins,</hi> and full
Title to <hi>Heaven! Brethren, I ſpeak after the Manner of Men; tho' it be
but a Man's Teſtament, yet, if it be confirmed, no Man diſannulleth, or
addeth thereto.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. iii. 15.</note> How much leſs
then can any Man take upon him to <hi>diſannul</hi> this <hi>last Will</hi>
and <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>'s, which he has left to his
<hi>Church;</hi> and <hi>Bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> it to her with His <hi>Dying</hi>
Breath!</p>
            <p>This was the Reaſon that it was not only ſo particularly
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by the ſeveral <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> in the <hi>Goſpels;</hi>
but when St. <hi>Paul</hi> was taught Immediately from <hi>Heaven,</hi> this
moſt Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial <hi>Inſtitution</hi> was not forgot, but <hi>Christ</hi>
Himſelf inſtructed him in it; to ſhew the great Streſs and Value which
He laid upon it.</p>
            <p>And let this ſuffice, to have ſaid in this place, concerning
this other Sacrament of <hi>the Lord's Supper.</hi> Its <hi>Inſtitution</hi>
is as Plain and Expreſs as that of <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> And the
<hi>Practiſe</hi> of it, in the Days of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and all Ages
ſince has been as <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal.</hi> And what has been ſaid of
<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> is of Equal Force as to this: And the <hi>Quaker</hi>
Arguments againſt this, are upon the ſame Foundation as thoſe againſt
<hi>Baptiſm;</hi> only they have not ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Objections againſt this:
Therefore I have made <hi>Baptiſm</hi> the chief Subject of this
Diſcourſe; yet ſo, as likewiſe to Include the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of
<hi>the Lord's Supper.</hi> Therefore we will go on to conſider what remains
of the preſent Objection (which Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates equally againſt both) that there
are no <hi>Signs</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. And here let me obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>First,</hi> That theſe <hi>Signs</hi> and
<hi>Figures</hi> which the <hi>Quakers</hi> make Incompatible to the
<hi>Goſpel</hi> State, ought only to be underſtood of the <hi>Signs</hi>
and <hi>Figures</hi> in the <hi>Law,</hi> which were ordain'd as <hi>Types</hi>
of <hi>Christ.</hi> And of theſe it is truly argu'd, That when
<hi>Christ,</hi> who is the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> is come, they muſt ceaſe
of courſe; which Argument the <hi>Quakers</hi> bring againſt the
<hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:95759:32"/>which <hi>Christ</hi>
did Inſtitute under the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> But how foreign this is from their
purpoſe, let any one judge. For thoſe <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi>
which were appointed by <hi>Christ,</hi> cou'd not be <hi>Types</hi> of
<hi>Christ;</hi> becauſe a <hi>Type</hi> is what goes <hi>before</hi> a
Thing, and ſhews it <hi>to come.</hi> And therefore, when that which it
<hi>foreſhews</hi> is come, it ceaſes. But, as there were <hi>Types</hi>
under the <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>foreſhew</hi> Chriſt's coming in the
<hi>Fleſh,</hi> and his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> which
therefore are ceaſed; ſo <hi>Christ</hi> has appointed other <hi>Types</hi>
to foreſhew his <hi>ſecond coming</hi> to Judge the World; and which
therefore muſt laſt till he ſhall ſo come, as the <hi>Types</hi> of his
<hi>first coming</hi> did laſt, till he did ſo come. The
<hi>Sacrifices</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> did <hi>praefigure</hi> the
<hi>Death of Christ;</hi> but the <hi>Sacraments</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> were Inſtituted in <hi>Remembrance</hi> of it; as well as
for <hi>Types</hi> of our future <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with <hi>him</hi> in
<hi>Heaven.</hi> Therefore the ſame Reaſon which makes the <hi>Legal
Types</hi> to <hi>ceaſe,</hi> does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, That the <hi>Evangelical
Types</hi> muſt <hi>not ceaſe,</hi> till they likewiſe ſhall be
<hi>fulfilled;</hi> which will not be till we arrive at <hi>Heaven.</hi> Thus,
as they are <hi>Types.</hi> And then,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As they are <hi>Remembrances</hi> of what
is paſt, they are to laſt as long as the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of that which
they <hi>Repreſent</hi> ought to laſt with us. <hi>Christ</hi> did not
Inſtitute <hi>his Supper,</hi> that we ſhou'd thereby <hi>Remember</hi> his
<hi>Death,</hi> a <hi>Day,</hi> or a <hi>Year,</hi> but till his <hi>Coming
again.</hi> His <hi>Death</hi> took his <hi>Perſonal</hi> Preſence from us;
and therefore till that Return, we muſt continue the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,</hi>
that is, of his <hi>Abſence,</hi> till the Glorious Return of his
<hi>Viſible Body,</hi> which was ſeparated from us by his
<hi>Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus no advantage can be brought to the <hi>Quaker</hi> Pretences
againſt the <hi>Chriſtian Sacraments,</hi> from the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and
other <hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Figures</hi> under the <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. We come now to Examine, what they ſet up againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Figures</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> from another
Topick; and that is, That the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is all <hi>Subſtance,</hi>
and therefore that there muſt be no <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> at all
in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> By <hi>Subſtance</hi> here they mean that which
is <hi>Inward,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual,</hi> that every thing in the
<hi>Goſpel</hi> is <hi>Spiritual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this will overthrow all <hi>outward,</hi> or <hi>Bodily</hi>
Worſhip. For that is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Spiritual,</hi> or
<hi>Inward</hi> Worſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:95759:33"/>And, in one ſenſe, all <hi>Bodily</hi>
Worſhip is a <hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Inward,</hi> or
<hi>Spiritual;</hi> which is the <hi>Principal</hi> and <hi>Subſtantial</hi>
Worſhip. Thus <hi>Bowing</hi> the <hi>Knee,</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncovering</hi> the
<hi>Head</hi> at <hi>Prayer,</hi> are <hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Figures</hi> of the
<hi>Inward Reverence</hi> and <hi>Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this the <hi>Quakers</hi> practiſe; therefore, by their own
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, they have <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> as well as others;
only they throw off thoſe of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Inſtitution, and make new
ones of their own.</p>
            <p>It is impoſſible to be without <hi>Signs</hi> and
<hi>Figures.</hi> For this whole World is a <hi>Figure</hi> of that which is to
come. We our ſelves are <hi>Figures</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> being
<hi>Images</hi> of him: And what is an <hi>Image</hi> but the <hi>Figure</hi>
or <hi>Sign</hi> of a Thing? <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a <hi>Figure</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> being <hi>the Expreſs Image of his Perſon,</hi> Heb. i. 3.
And we now have the Knowledge of God <hi>in the Face of Jeſus Christ.
God</hi> is a <hi>Light</hi> Inacceſſible to <hi>Angels,</hi> as well as
unto <hi>Men,</hi> without ſome <hi>Medium:</hi> His <hi>Eſſence</hi>
cannot be ſeen or known <hi>Immediately,</hi> by any but <hi>Himſelf.</hi>
All <hi>Creatures</hi> partake of him in <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Figures</hi> of
him; each in their ſeveral Degrees; there are <hi>Higher</hi> and more
<hi>Noble Figures;</hi> but all are <hi>Figures.</hi> And God has, in all Ages,
through the World, Diſpenſed himſelf to Mankind in <hi>Signs</hi> and
<hi>Figures;</hi> we cou'd not otherwiſe apprehend Him. <hi>Christ</hi> is
the moſt <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and <hi>Lively Figure</hi> of <hi>God:</hi>
Therefore his Diſpenſation is far beyond all others that went before him.
Yet even now, <hi>We ſee through a Glaſs darkly,</hi> 1 Cor. xiii. 12. or,
<hi>in a Riddle;</hi> as our <hi>Margent</hi> reads it,
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, in a <hi>Figure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is <hi>the Bible</hi> that we read, what are <hi>Words</hi> but
the <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natures,</hi> the <hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Figures</hi> of
<hi>Things?</hi> We can ſee the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of no one thing in the
World, more than of <hi>God.</hi> And what are all thoſe <hi>Accidents</hi>
of <hi>Colour, Quantity</hi> and <hi>Quality,</hi> by which we diſtinguiſh
Things, but ſo many <hi>Figures,</hi> or <hi>Signs</hi> of them?</p>
            <p>So very wild is that Notion, that there muſt be no <hi>Signs</hi>
or <hi>Figures</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be much <hi>Truer,</hi> if they had ſaid, That there are
no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Figures:</hi> There is nothing
elſe without a <hi>Figure</hi> but <hi>God!</hi> For all <hi>Creatures</hi>
are <hi>Figures of Him, Christ, the Highest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:95759:33"/>But have the <hi>Quakers</hi> no <hi>Figures? G.

               <hi>Was above the State of the firſt</hi> Adam, <hi>in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency; in the

valu'd by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> more than St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s,) That his
Marriage was a <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the

deny'd, tho' it be not Printed with the reſt of his Epiſtles, but I have it
from ſome that read it often. But why was it not Printed? That was a ſad
Story. But take it thus. He Marry'd one <hi>Margaret Fell,</hi> a Widdow, of
about <hi>Threeſcore</hi> Years of Age; and this <hi>Figure</hi> of the
<hi>Church</hi> muſt not be <hi>Barren;</hi> therefore, tho' ſhe was paſt
Child-bearing, it was expected, that, as <hi>Sarah,</hi> ſhe ſhou'd
miraculouſly Conceive, and bring forth an <hi>Iſaac;</hi> which <hi>G.
Fox</hi> promis'd and boaſted of, and ſome that I know have heard him do
it, more than once. She was call'd, <hi>The Lamb's Wife.</hi> And it was ſaid
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> That the <hi>Lamb</hi> had now taken his
<hi>Wife,</hi> and ſhe wou'd bring forth an <hi>Holy Seed.</hi> And Big ſhe
grew, and all things were provided for the <hi>Lying in;</hi> and, he, being
perſwaded of it, gave notice to the Churches, as above obſerv'd. But, after
long waiting, all prov'd <hi>Abortive,</hi> and the <hi>Figure</hi> was
ſpoil'd. And now you may gueſs the Reaſon, why that <hi>Epiſtle</hi>
which mention'd this <hi>Figure,</hi> was not <hi>Printed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wou'd have brought nothing into this Diſcourſe that looks like
a <hi>Jest;</hi> but they have compelled me. And it may be of uſe to them, to
ſhew them, that while they throw off the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> of
<hi>Christ</hi>'s Inſtitution, upon the Pretence that there muſt be no
<hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Figures</hi> under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> they, at the
ſame<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95759:34"/>time, make Ridiculous <hi>Signs</hi> and
<hi>Figures</hi> of <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and his Fantaſtical <hi>Marriage;</hi>
and of ſeveral other things; every thing almoſt among them, is a
<hi>Sign</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> of ſomething to come upon the World. How
many of their <hi>Lying Prophets</hi> have call'd themſelves <hi>Signs</hi>
to the Men of their Generation, as the <hi>Holy Prophets</hi> were in their
Day?</p>
            <p n="7">VII. There have been <hi>Outward Signs,</hi> in all the
Inſtitutions of Religion, ſince the beginning of the World; as well
<hi>before,</hi> as <hi>under</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> and now under the
<hi>Goſpel.</hi> Only they have been <hi>vary'd,</hi> or <hi>Ended</hi>
according to what they praefigur'd. Thus thoſe <hi>Signs</hi> which had no
further Tendency, than to point out what <hi>Christ</hi> did or ſuffer'd upon
<hi>Earth,</hi> are <hi>fulfill'd</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there were ſome <hi>Signs,</hi> which, though they pointed to
<hi>Christ</hi> upon <hi>Earth,</hi> had yet a further Tendency: For
<hi>Signs</hi> may be appointed to more Ends than one. Thus the Inſtitution
of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was appointed for the Commemoration of God's
<hi>Rest</hi> from the Works of the <hi>Creation, Gen.</hi> ii. 3. and
<hi>Exod.</hi> xx. 11. and likewiſe the reſt of the Children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> (who were the <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>) from
their <hi>Captivity</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> in <hi>Egypt, Deut.</hi> v. 15.
(which expreſſes the Servitude of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi>) and their
final <hi>Rest</hi> in <hi>Canaan</hi> (the Type of <hi>Heaven</hi>) after
their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years wandering in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> (which repreſent
the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of this Life.) But this was not the Ultimate <hi>Rest,</hi> or
<hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> Heb. iv. 18. <hi>For if</hi> Joſhua <hi>had given them
Reſt, then wou'd he not afterward have ſpoken of another Day; there
remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth therefore <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the keeping
of a Sabbath</hi> (which ſignifies <hi>Rest</hi>) <hi>to the People of God.
For he that is entred into his Reſt, he alſo hath ceaſed from his own
Works, as God did from his.</hi> Thus <hi>Christ,</hi> as he ſuffered the 6th
Day of the Week, the ſame Day that <hi>Man</hi> was <hi>created,</hi> and
<hi>fell;</hi> ſo, on the ſame Day on which God Reſted from his Work of
<hi>Creation, viz.</hi> the 7th Day, did <hi>Christ</hi> Reſt in his Grave,
from his Work of <hi>Redemption.</hi> And there is yet a farther
<hi>Reſt</hi> or <hi>Sabbath</hi> beyond this; and that is, the Eternal
<hi>Reſt</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> Heb. iv. 11. <hi>Let us labour therefore to
enter into that Reſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, though ſeveral Significations of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> are

            <p>But there is another Reaſon for the Continuance of the
<hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;</hi> and that is, That it was not only ordained as a
<hi>Type</hi> of Things to come; but as a Commemoration of what was paſt,
<hi>viz.</hi> Of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Reſt</hi> from his Works of
<hi>Creation.</hi> And, by the Alteration of the <hi>Day</hi> of the
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> it ſerves likewiſe to us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as a
Commemoration of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his
Conqueſt over the Powers of <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Hell.</hi> It was the
<hi>firſt Day</hi> in which <hi>Light</hi> was created; and <hi>Chriſt</hi>
(who is our <hi>True Light,</hi> of which the <hi>Viſible Light</hi> is but a

<hi>Dead,</hi> the <hi>ſame Day;</hi> and gave <hi>Light</hi> to thoſe who
ſat in <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and the <hi>Shadow</hi> of <hi>Death,</hi> by the
Joyful Tidings of our <hi>Redemption</hi> from <hi>Hell,</hi> and <hi>Eternal
Bliſs</hi> in <hi>Heaven!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſo long as the Works of our <hi>Creation</hi> and
<hi>Redemption</hi> are to be kept in Memory, ſo long is the <hi>Sabbath</hi>
to continue, as a Commemoration of theſe Ineſtimable Benefits.</p>
            <p>And, by the ſame Reaſon, ſo long as we ought to comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate
the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> of <hi>our Lord;</hi> ſo long
ought the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of it to continue; which he Inſtituted in

            </p>
            <p>Thus you ſee that there are <hi>Signs</hi> under the

(which flowed diſtinctly out of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Side, after his

ſuch <hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Types</hi> as have yet a Proſpect forward, and
are not wholly fulfill'd.</p>
            <p>And 3<hi>dly,</hi> The <hi>Signs</hi> of <hi>Preſent

which we are as much, nay more ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi>
than they were under the <hi>Law.</hi> As St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> argues,
(<hi>adverſ. Haereſ.</hi> l. 4. c. 34.) That the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of
<hi>Worſhip,</hi> as of <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> is chang'd: but not the

The<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95759:35"/>
               <hi>Kind</hi> or <hi>Nature</hi> of the

<hi>Offerings</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> and there are <hi>Offerings</hi>
alſo under the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> there were <hi>Sacrifices</hi> among the
People of the <hi>Jews.</hi> There are <hi>Sacrifices</hi> likewiſe in the
<hi>Church:</hi> but the <hi>Species</hi> or <hi>Manner</hi> of them only is
changed, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſome <hi>Sacrifices</hi> under the <hi>Law</hi>
were <hi>Bloody,</hi> as Praefiguring the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Christ:</hi>
and therefore that <hi>Sort</hi> or <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Sacrificing</hi> is
<hi>ceaſed,</hi> becauſe <hi>Fulfill'd</hi> in the <hi>Death</hi> of
<hi>Christ:</hi> But their <hi>

were under the <hi>Law.</hi> The <hi>outward Worſhip</hi> of <hi>God</hi>

And, in the very next words, he applies this to <hi>Tythes. Et propter hoc illi

Receiv'd All from Him: And in Hopes of their Receiving More from Him. <hi>Sed

inſtead of <hi>Adultery,</hi> to forbid <hi>Lust;</hi> inſtead of
<hi>Murder,</hi> to forbid <hi>Anger;</hi> and, inſtead of giving the
<hi>Tythe,</hi> commanding to ſell <hi>All:</hi> And this, ſays he, <hi>is
not a Diſſolving of the Law, but Enlarging it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. v. 17, 18.</note> So that no Part of the <hi>Law</hi> is
<hi>Deſtroy'd;</hi> and <hi>All</hi> is not <hi>Fulfill'd;</hi> and ſince
<hi>All</hi> muſt be <hi>Fulfill'd,</hi> it follows, that what is not yet

in the <hi>Law</hi> not being <hi>Fulfill'd</hi> in <hi>Christ's Death,</hi>
nor ever to be <hi>Fulfill'd</hi> while we Live upon this Earth, conſequently
do <hi>Remain,</hi> and muſt ſo Remain to the End of the World. So that the

Part, the ſame <hi>Signs;</hi> with other <hi>Sacramental Signs</hi> added by
<hi>Christ,</hi> which are thoſe of which we now Treat, <hi>Baptiſm,</hi>
and <hi>The Supper</hi> of <hi>The Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">VIII. And let us Reflect, that ever ſince God made
<hi>outward</hi> Things, and gave us this <hi>Body,</hi> as the <hi>Soul</hi>
does act by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of the <hi>Body;</hi> ſo has God ordain'd, that

               <hi>Chriſt</hi> us'd <hi>outward Signs</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> for
his <hi>Miraculous Cures;</hi> to ſhew, that tho' the <hi>Vertue</hi> did not
come from the <hi>Means,</hi> yet that they were of Uſe, and not to be
Deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>But why do we ſay, that the <hi>Vertue</hi> does not come from the
<hi>Means?</hi> We ſay ſo, when we cannot tell the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and
<hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> how the <hi>Means</hi> work their <hi>Effect,</hi> and can we
tell it, in thoſe which we call <hi>Natural</hi> Means? No ſurely, we know
only by <hi>Obſervation,</hi> and <hi>Experience;</hi> and what often comes
to paſs, we call it <hi>Natural,</hi> as being the common Courſe of Things;
not that we know the Reaſon of it, more than of thoſe Occurrences which we
call <hi>Miraculous</hi> and <hi>Extraordinary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Man doth not live by Bread alone, but by every Word that
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of the Mouth of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bread</hi> has no Vertue of its own to <hi>nouriſh;</hi> but
only what it receives from <hi>God:</hi> And if he give his <hi>Vertue</hi>
(for it is <hi>His only</hi>) to a <hi>Stone;</hi> or any thing elſe, it will
<hi>nouriſh:</hi> And <hi>Bread</hi> will, and does ceaſe to
<hi>nouriſh,</hi> when he withdraws his <hi>Bleſſing</hi> from it.</p>
            <p>Therefore the <hi>Spittle</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the
<hi>Clay,</hi> the <hi>Waters</hi> of <hi>Siloam</hi> and <hi>Betheſda,</hi>
and the <hi>Brazen-Serpent</hi> had as great Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to Cure, when they were
Appointed by <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Bread</hi> has to <hi>nouriſh;</hi> and the
Vertue came as much from <hi>Them,</hi> as it does from the <hi>Bread,</hi> in
our Daily Food.</p>
            <p>Now, if the <hi>Brazen-Serpent,</hi> which was but a <hi>Type</hi>
of <hi>Christ,</hi> had Vertue to Cure the <hi>Body;</hi> ſhall we deny that
the <hi>Bread,</hi> which <hi>Christ</hi> bleſſed, for the
<hi>Remiſſion</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> has Vertue to work that Effect?</p>
            <p>He whoſe ſingle <hi>Fiat</hi> made the Worlds, and whoſe
Influence gives Power to all Things, and makes them what they are; he ſaid of
that <hi>Bleſſed Bread,</hi> THIS IS MY BODY. And his Holy Apoſtle ſaid
of it, <hi>The Bread which we break, is it not the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Body of
Chriſt?</hi> And do we doubt, how it works this Effect? Dare we Reject it,
becauſe it ſeems ſtrange to us, how it ſhou'd work this Effect, who
know as little how our <hi>Daily Bread</hi> does nouriſh our <hi>Bodies?</hi>
Do we object our Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance how a Man can be <hi>Born</hi> of <hi>Water</hi>
and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> who can give as ſhort an Account how we are formed,
of a drop of <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> in the Womb; and by what Ligaments ſuch
different <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:95759:36"/>as <hi>Soul</hi> and
<hi>Body,</hi> are compacted and linked together? How can we pretend to have
<hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and yet not believe his <hi>Words,</hi>
becauſe of the ſeeming difficulty to our Underſtandings (who know
nothing) of the <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Manner,</hi> how He can bring them to
paſs?</p>
            <p>According to our <hi>Faith</hi> it will be unto us. Therefore let us
<hi>Humble</hi> our <hi>Souls</hi> greatly, and imitate the <hi>Holy
Angels</hi> (far more <hi>Enlightned</hi> than we are) who <hi>vail</hi> their
<hi>Faces</hi> before <hi>God;</hi> and preſume not to diſpute his
Commands; or pretend to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all the <hi>Methods</hi> of his
<hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> unſearchable! but <hi>deſire to look
into thoſe Things,</hi> 1 Pet. i. 12. thoſe Glorious <hi>Myſteries</hi>
of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which the <hi>Quakers</hi> deſpiſe, as below the

thinking it uncapable to teach them any thing, or to adminiſter to them the
<hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> has commanded.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Diſpute will ariſe which that <hi>Church</hi>
is, in the miſerable Diviſions of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and amongſt the

            <p>THE Sum of what has been ſaid, concludes in the great

            </p>
            <p>But before I ſay more of it, I will obviate an Objection, which

            </p>
            <p>If it be <hi>Abſolutely</hi> Neceſſary, then none can be
<hi>ſaved</hi> without it: Which ſort of <hi>Neceſſity</hi> I do not
plead for. This is plainly diſtinguiſhed in the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> of
<hi>our Church,</hi> where <hi>this,</hi> and the <hi>other Sacrament</hi> (of

to <hi>Salvation. Generally,</hi> that is, in the <hi>General</hi> and
<hi>Common</hi> Methods which are preſcribed in the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> For no

            </p>
            <p>But who are they who have Reaſon to expect God's

            <p n="1">I. Thoſe who being conſcientiouſly concern'd for the

who doth not Believe, and is not</hi> Baptized, <hi>ſhall not be Saved.</hi>
Of which I adjure the <hi>Quakers</hi> to Conſider moſt ſeriouſly: For
tho' they had the <hi>Inward Baptiſm</hi> as much as they Pretend to it, yet
were the <hi>Outward</hi> neceſſary. <hi>Peter</hi> thought <hi>Water</hi>
neceſſary to give <hi>Outward Baptiſm</hi> to thoſe who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
Received the <hi>Inward Baptiſm</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts x.
47.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Doctrine of Baptiſm</hi> is reckon'd among the
<hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> and <hi>Foundations</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi>
together with <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> VI.
1, 2.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Quakers,</hi> like <hi>Naaman,</hi> flout at the
<hi>Means,</hi> as too <hi>eaſie</hi> to be <hi>effectual;</hi> and call
<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> in contempt, <hi>Water-Sprinkling,</hi> And I will anſwer
them with <hi>Naaman</hi>'s Servants, (2 <hi>Kings</hi> V. 13.) <hi>If Chriſt
had bid thee do ſome great thing,<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95759:38"/>wouldſt thou not have
done it? How much rather then when He ſaith to thee, Waſh and be
Clean?</hi> And as <hi>neceſſary</hi> as the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of
<hi>Jordan</hi> were to the <hi>Cleanſing</hi> of <hi>Naaman,</hi> ſo
<hi>neceſſary</hi> are the <hi>Waters</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to the
<hi>Cleanſing</hi> of our <hi>Souls.</hi> None dare ſay, that GOD cou'd not
have Cleanſed <hi>Naaman</hi> otherwiſe: But GOD having, by his
<hi>Prophet,</hi> appointed that Means, if <hi>Naaman</hi> had neglected it, he
had not otherwiſe been Cured. How much more, when GOD has appointed the Means
of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> by his <hi>Son,</hi> if we <hi>Neglect</hi> it, ſhall
we be <hi>Sav'd</hi> without it? <hi>He that Deſpis'd</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Law,
dyed without Mercy: Of how much ſorer Paniſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall
he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the</hi> Inſtitution <hi>of
the Son of GOD, and counted it an unholy thing, doing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite to it,</hi>
Inventing <hi>Contemptible Names</hi> for it, and <hi>Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> the
<hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of it? But as the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God
moved,</hi> at firſt, <hi>upon the Face of the Waters</hi> (Gen. 1. 2.) to
<hi>Impregnate</hi> them, and make them <hi>Fructiſie;</hi> and gave a
<hi>Miraculous</hi> Vertue to the <hi>Waters</hi> of <hi>Jordan,</hi> of
<hi>Siloam,</hi> and <hi>Betheſda,</hi> for Healing of the <hi>Fleſh;</hi>
Why ſhou'd we Doubt that the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> can and will
<hi>Sanctifie</hi> the <hi>Waters</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to the
<hi>Myſtical Waſhing away of Sin,</hi> having the Poſitive
<hi>Inſtitution</hi> and <hi>Promiſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for it?
<hi>Acts</hi> II. 38. <hi>Repent and be Baptized, every one of you, in the Name
of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Remiſſion of Sins, and ye ſhall Receive the
Gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was not the <hi>Extraordinary Gift</hi> of <hi>Miracles,</hi>
which is here Promiſed, (and which all <hi>Baptized</hi> Perſons did not
<hi>Receive</hi> or <hi>Expect</hi>) but the <hi>Remiſſion of Sins.</hi>
And let me add, That the <hi>Ordinary Saving Graces</hi> of the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> which work <hi>ſilently,</hi> without <hi>Obſervation</hi>
or <hi>Show,</hi> are much Preferable, and more Deſirable, than the
<hi>Extraordinary Gift</hi> of <hi>Miracles,</hi> which, for a time, were
Neceſſary, at the firſt Propagation of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> and held
Men's Eyes in Great Admiration: But were of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequence to the
Poſſeſſors, and a <hi>Temptation</hi> often to <hi>Vanity;</hi> which
had almoſt over-ſet the Great <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 2 Cor. xii. 7, 8, 9. and
threw others into the Pit of Deſtruction, <hi>Matth.</hi> vii. 22, 23. 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 2. and therefore were not to be <hi>Pray'd</hi> for, or
<hi>Deſir'd:</hi> We muſt be totally <hi>Paſſive</hi> in this Caſe;
and when ſent, being for the Conviction of others, to Receive ſuch an
<hi>Extraordinary Gift,</hi> with <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Trembling,</hi> leſt
it Hurt<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95759:38"/>our <hi>weak Minds,</hi> not capable, but by as
<hi>Extraordinary</hi> an Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> to Bear
ſuch mighty <hi>Revelations,</hi> and not to let in with it a ſecret
<hi>Pride</hi> in our ſelves; which ſpreads our <hi>Sails</hi> ſo wide,
that without a Proportionable <hi>Ballaſt</hi> of deep <hi>Humility,</hi> we
ſhall be driven from our <hi>Compaſs.</hi> The Enemy throws in this
ſtrong <hi>Temptation,</hi> with thoſe <hi>Miraculous Gifts;</hi> which
<hi>vain</hi> Men do <hi>Ignorantly</hi> Covet, and ſome falſly
<hi>Pretend</hi> to, to their own <hi>Deſtruction.</hi> But much more
<hi>Valuable</hi> are thoſe Saving <hi>Graces,</hi> which we are commanded
Daily to <hi>Pray</hi> for, and Daily to <hi>Endeavour:</hi> Much more
<hi>Available</hi> to us, and <hi>Precious</hi> in the ſight of God, than all
<hi>Miraculous Gifts,</hi> is that <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>The Holy Ghost,</hi>
the <hi>Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> which is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to the Due Reception of
<hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and enrolls our <hi>Names</hi> in Heaven. <hi>Behold</hi>
(ſaid <hi>Christ</hi> to his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> who <hi>Boaſted,</hi>
that <hi>even the Devils were ſubject to them, through His Name</hi>) <hi>I
give unto you Power to tread on Serpents and Scorpions, and over all the Power
of the Enemy; and nothing ſhall, by any means, hurt you; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this Rejoice not, that the Spirits are ſubject unto you; But rather
Rejoice, becauſe your Names are written in Heaven.</hi>

            <p>But <hi>R. Barclay</hi> argues in his <hi>Apology,</hi> That the

the <hi>Outward,</hi> or <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> becauſe that it ſelf is
